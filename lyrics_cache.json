We move to the eyes, pure in their fury. Finally we\nencompass the face -- the face of a man about to explode --\nmuscle, tissue, brain -- a man willing to live or die and\non the increment of a moment, inflict or receive either one.\nHe is clothed in rags crossed with holes, his shoes broken\ncardboard, his hair unkempt, his complexion sallow from\nprison.\nOver this:\nVOICE #1 (o.s.)\nOkay so what do you call yourself?\n\nVOICE #2 (o.s.)\nComo se llama?\nMONTANA\nTony Montana...you?\nVOICE #1\nWhere'd you learn to speak the English, Tony?\nMONTANA\nMy old man -- he was American.

No way.\nWe now reveal three men in civilian clothing in the dark afternoon light of the little room. Actually it's a plywood office somewhere in the processing hall and we hear the din from the hall over the question and answer. Two of the men sit around a desk, the Third Man stands in a corner, staring at Tony, the most authoritative-looking of the three.\nMAN #l\n(checking off a list)\nYou been in a mental hospital, Tony?\nTONY\n(grinning)\nYeah, in the boat coming over.\nMAN #1\nHow 'bout homosexuality, Tony?

Vagrancy? Marijuana?\nTONY\nNO. ...NO. Never. Nothing.\nHis eye movements are rapid (over shoulders, sides, doors)\nand he does a lot of touching -- objects -- lightly with the\ntips of the fingers.

You should see the other kid.\n(a grim chuckle)\nMAN #3\nAnd this?\nHe holds up Tony's hand and indicates the tattoo between the\nthumb and second finger -- a heart with the word \"Madre\"\nscaled through it.\nTONY\nOh that was for my sweetheart.\nMAN #3\nSweetheart?\n(to the other men)\nWe been seeing more and more of these. It's some kinda code these guys used in the can. Pitchfork means an assassin\nor something. This one's new...

Big deal.\nMAN #3\nThat's pretty funny, Tony.\nTONY\nSome Canadian tourist....\nMAN #3\nWhat'd you mug him first?

You a Communist or something?\nHow would you like it they tell you all the time what to think, what to do, you wanna be like a sheep, like everybody else. Baa baa? Puta!

Hey, I'm no little whore, I'm no stinking thief! I'm Tony Montana and I'm a political prisoner here from Cuba and I want my fucking 'Human Rights' just like President Jimmy Carter says, okay?\nSilence.\nThere's a certain eloquence to the man`s plea but\nit falls on disbelieving ears. One of them chuckles.\nMAN #l\nCarter should see this human right. He's good. He's very good. What do you say Harry?\nMAN #3\n(walking out)\nI... 'Freedomtown.' Let them take a look at him. A long look.\nTONY\nHey, that's okay, too, Harry. No hard feelings.\nMan #3 at the door stops, looks back.\nTONY\nSend me here, send me there. This.\nThat.

He takes the Baby Ruth out\nof Manny's hand, peels out the bar of chocolate, then\nreturns the empty wrapper to Manny,\nTONY\nSo what'd you tell them?\nMANNY\nI told them what you told me to tell them. I told them I was in sanitation in Cuba.\nTONY\nI didn't tell you sanitation. I told you to tell them you was in a sanitarium, not sanitation.\nThe bus pulling out now.\nMANNY\nIs that what you told me?

Conscience.\nIf you believe you've got a conscience, it`ll pester you to death. But if you don't believe you've got one, what can it do to you?

Hunh? Like me....\nHe hunches, darting exaggerated looks over his shoulder,\nimitating Bogart. Manny laughs. In his black shirt with\nzig-zag dots and colors and the baggy pants and sunglasses,\nTony's starting to look American. He's even got himself a\npop button pinned to his shirt that says \"Fuck Off and Die.\"\nAnd his English rolls faster off his tongue, his confidence\nmore pronounced.\nTONY\n. . . don't trust nobody.\nMANNY\nYeah all that gold, hunh -- I guess you get so crazy you never trust nobody no more.\nTONY\nNever happen to me, Chico.

Tony stares at it, his mind drifting as the phone\nrings in a distant place. A brief moment of repose we have\nnot yet seen in Tony.\nSomeone picks up the phone. An older woman's Voice. His\nexpression alters to uncertainty.\nVOICE\nYes? ...Hello? ...Who is this?\nTony changes his mind, hangs up. Pause. The faces of those\nin line peer in, the next party raps on the door, but Tony\nignores it, slips the snapshot back into the wallet in his\npants, then at his own pace, exits the phone booth.\nHe walks a few beats, his eyes pensive. Then recognizes\nsomebody in another phone booth and goes over.\nAngel Fernandez has got the face of one, as he argues on\nthe phone, then hangs up, a desolate look on his face, a\nworn phone book in his hand.\nTONY\nAngel, how ya doin'?\nANGEL\nYou know how many goddamn Fernandezes are living in fucking Union City?

Lookit those tits man, she's begging for it!\nAt the curb, an old crone hunchbacks her way in front of the teenage chick, who is coming off the beach in a bikini, blocking her off.\nCHI-CHI\n(looking over)\nWhatta you crazy? She's 103 years old.\nMANNY\nNot her stupido! Her....\nCamera revealing the teenager.\nTONY\n(the light changing)\nDrive, willya.\nMANNY\n(mocking)\nSure, sure. Not to worry, Tony -- You get a heart attack.\n(looking in the rearview mirror)\nAngel, whatcha wearing the face for?\nANGEL\n(tense, making light of it)\nAh, it's okay. I just y'know forgot to make an offering. I was supposed to go by the madrina today.\nMANNY\nYou still going to that cuncha?\nANGEL\nShe knows her shit. She talks to Yemaya and Chango like nobody y'ever heard.\nAs he talks Angel fingers a Negrita charm hanging around\nhis neck -- Chango, God of Fire and Thunder, his black face\ntilted at a carnal angle. Sharp teeth glinting, his eyes\nrolling in orgasmic imagery, his head crowned with gold.\nMany of the Marielitos in the film will be wearing this,\nalso pendants with an eye to ward off the evil spirits, red\nand white beads, red kerchiefs, black hand charms silver-\nbangled bracelets, etc., all relating to their Afro-Catholic\nspiritualism.\nMANNY\n(making fun)\nYeah, Chango looking out for us,\nCHI-CHI\nAngel?\nANGEL\nChango looking out for all the 'bandidos' everywhere. But you gotta pay him his dues, y'know. You gotta let him know you respect him. You don't, Chango -- he gets pissed an'...\nTONY\n(angry)\nHey, shaddup -- all of ya! I told you before I don't go for that mystical voodoo shit. That's for the old cunchas waving their rooster cocks in some dark alley, There's no gods, there's no Chango -- nowhere! You make your own luck. So shaddup and act like you're in the United States here.\nSilence. Through the windshield, the sign of a motel -- THE SUN RAY -- is coming closer.\nTONY\nOkay, this is it. Pull over across the street.\nThe motel is coming closer in silence.\nTONY\n(to Manny)\nMoney stays in the trunk till I come out and get it. Me. Nobody else. If I'm not out in fifteen minutes, something's wrong. I'm in Room 9. You ready, Angelito?\nANGEL\nSure thing.\nAs Manny pulls the car up, they pull out Ingram Model-10\nmachine pistol with folding butt and suppressor, ten inches\nof kill power capable of firing 1100 rounds a minute -- it\ncan be slipped into a man's purse, it's in vogue. Tony getting out, to Angel:\nTONY\nLet's go....\nCUT TO\n33 EXT. SUN-RAY MOTEL - DAY\nTony and Angel come slowly, gingerly down an exterior\ncorridor to a room marked \"9\". Nodding to Angel who remains in the stairwell with the Ingram machine pistol, Tony knocks.\nPause.\n34 EXT. TOAD'S MOTEL ROOM - DAY\nThe door's opened casually by an ugly, squat five-foot-four-inch Colombian, \"The Toad\". He's in his forties, sports shirt hanging over his polyester pants, old acne scars on his face, like Omar; he's good natured, a nice guy, he smiles.\nTOAD\nHey, oye amigo....\nSpreading his arms in such a fashion to indicate he's clean.\n35 INT. TOAD'S MOTEL ROOM - DAY\nTony, stepping into the conventionally tasteless orange and\nblue motel room (with heavy blue drapes blocking the windows), spreads his hands in a similar posture indicating he too is not carrying; but this is only symbolic, it's not meant to be a body search.\nTONY\n(as he steps in)\nHow you doing amigo...?\nThe other person in the room is a tough-looking little dark\nColombian chick with expressionless eyes, red fingernails, and short boy-cut hair, \"The Lizard\"; she's tinier than the Toad, about five-two.\nThe Toad looks around the corridor, eases the door closed.\nTONY\n(checking out the room)\nMind leaving the door open so my brothers know everything's okay... okay?\nToad shrugs and readjusts, leaving it open a few inches,\nthe conversation clipped and nervous throughout the scene.\nTOAD\nSure, no problem... This is Marta.\nTONY\nHello, Marta.\nShe nods woodenly, stays across the room. Behind her, the\ntelevision set is on to the Cable Newswatch. The protagonists\nintermittently flick their eyes to it, soothing the tension.\nTOAD\nI'm Hector...\nPause.\nTONY\nYeah. I'm Tony. So Omar says you're okay.\nTOAD\nYeah, Omar's okay.\nTONY\nYou know Omar.\nTOAD\nOmar, yeah, I talk to him on the phone.\nTONY\nOkay...\nTOAD\nOkay... so you got the money?\nTONY\nYeah, you got the stuff?\nTOAD\nSure I got the stuff, but I don't\ngot it right here with me. I got it\nclose by.\nTONY\nYeah well I don't got it either, I\ngot it close by, too.\nTOAD\nWhere, in the parking lot?\nTONY\nNo. How far's your stuff?\nTony paces back towards, the door casually, to check Angel\nout... The Lizard staring at him...\nTOAD\nNot far.\nPause. Everything seems okay.\nTONY\nSo what do we do, walk in and start over?\nTOAD\n(changes subject)\nWhere you from?\nTony's eyes check out the bathroom.\nTONY\nWhat fuckin' difference does it make where I'm from?\nTOAD\nI like to get to know who I do business with.\nIt's like he's stalling for time. The Lizard has made a\nmove somewhere off-center and is now sitting on the bed,\ncoiled and always watching.\nTONY\nYou get to know me when you start doing business and not fucking around, Hector.\nTOAD\nHey I'm just a friendly guy, maybe you don't...\nTONY\nOkay, what's the stall here? Your guy late or something?\n36 INT. TOAD'S MOTEL ROOM - DAY\nThere's suddenly a door slamming somewhere outside, then\ncommotion.\nANGEL\nTony!\nTony goes for his cheap handgun when he hears a frightening\nfemale shriek, like a bird.\nLIZARD\n(slang Spanish)\nDon't! Get up! Now shithead!\nShe's standing there with a .32 pointed steady at him, the eyes like angry steel. There's no mistaking her ability to shoot.\nThe Toad pulls a 9mm out of the small of his back, approaches Tony. Angel is shoved into the room, followed by two more\nColumbians, \"The Kids\".\nThey slam the door, both carrying Uzis with silencers, neither of them higher than five-four or older than twenty, with their straight black Indian hair cut across their blank eyes, they look like hungry little piranha careless about killing, muttering with the Lizard in fast Columbese slang.\nAs Toad strips the handgun from Tony:\nTONY\nFrog face, you just fucked up. You steal from me, you're dead.\nToad shrugs, he couldn't care less.\nTOAD\nYeah, okay, you gonna give me the cash or am I gonna kill your brother first? 'Fore I kill you?\nTONY\nWhy don't you try sticking your head up your ass? See if it fits\nToad, completing the body search, rips out the stiletto\ntaped to the small of Tony's back. As he mutters something\nin hard Columbian slang to the two kids who shove Angel\ninto the bathroom, producing strands of thick rope.\nEven more worrisome is the chainsaw that the Lizard now\npulls out of the suitcase under the bed. Toad begins\nassembling it as Lizard, still covering Tony with her gun, completes the deadpan process by turning up the volume on the television set. The news, ironically not in Miami, is about a drug-related triple-homicide.\nCUT TO:\n37 EXT. SUN-RAY MOTEL - DAY\nChi-Chi sitting at the wheel of the sedan, parked across\nthe street. Manny paces outside the car, glances.\n38 EXT. SUN-RAY MOTEL - DAY\nA small woman -- the Lizard -- steps out in shadow in the\nparking lot of the Sun-Ray across the street, looks around,\nsees nothing, casually goes back in.\n39 EXT. SUN-RAY MOTEL - DAY\nManny looks at his watch.\nCUT TO\n40 INT. TOAD'S MOTEL ROOM - DAY\nAngel hangs suspended on the ropes from the top of the shower curtain bar, his legs straddling the edge of the bathtub. Toad slaps a tape over his mouth.\nTony, covered by the two kids, watches from the lip of the\nbathroom. He bucks angrily but the two kids ram their\npistols up against his temple and pin him to the door.\nAngel looks at Tony; the eyes between them steady. They're\ndead and they know it.\nToad, well-prepared, connects a voltage adapter and extension cord.\nTOAD\n(to Tony)\nYou watch what happens to your friend okay? If you don't want this to happen to you, you get the money.\nLizard reenters the room, shakes her head at the Toad who\nnods and turns on the whirring machine.\nThe Toad smiles amiably and angles the chainsaw slowly\ntowards Angel.\nThe two kids press tight against Tony, guns pointed at his\nbrains... Off-camera, we know what's happening as we hear the chainsaw and we watch Tony's shock and rage.\nLizard has no expression on her face. The machine cuts off.\nThe Toad steps back from the tub, blood splattered on his shirt, examining his first cut like a butcher. He glances at Tony.\nTOAD\nNow the leg, hunh?\nA brief glimpse of Angel slumped by one arm like a cow on a strap, streaming blood, eyes conscious and horrified; a terrifying sight. The chainsaw whirrs once more.\nCUT TO\n41 EXT. SUN-RAY MOTEL - DAY\nManny, definitely suspecting something now, moves with\nChi-Chi across the parking lot of the Sun-Ray Motel. They\nsignal and separate.\nCUT TO\n42 INT. TOAD'S MOTEL ROOM - DAY\nThe Toad turns off the chainsaw and steps back, now drenched with Angel's blood, totally unaffected. He looks at Tony.\nTony glances back at him with fury, tears involuntarily dotting his eyes.\nTOAD\nOkay, my 'caracortada', you can die too. Makes no difference to me.\nHe nods. The kids shove Tony forward and we glimpse Angel\nlying hunkered at his feet in the bathtub, in the steam of\nhis blood, piss dead.\nCUT TO\n43 EXT. SUN-RAY MOTEL - DAY\nManny moves crouched down the exterior corridor, Ingram\npistol in hand, past an older couple who pretend not to\nnotice.\nAt the door of Room 9, Manny waits, listens...\nCUT TO\n44 INT.

TOAD'S MOTEL ROOM - DAY\nand the door smashes open and Manny barrels through and\nshoots a surprised Lizard as she raises her pistol. She crashes backwards into the room, wounded. Everything happens very fast now.\nManny is at the lip of the bathroom, he fires and hits kid\none, who is turning, in the neck.\nTony, not tied up yet, spins on kid two and smashes the unloosened strap across his face, sending him reeling across the bathroom.\nThe Toad, chainsaw in hand, slashes at Manny.\nManny fires a burst into him and the Toad crashes backwards.\nManny now spins into a wall, hit in the side.\nThe Lizard, wounded on her knees, is firing her .32 at\nhim. In the background, the window simultaneously blows out as Chi-Chi appears firing a burst with his Ingram.\nIn sharp foreground, the Lizard crumples forward on her knees, foaming blood.\nTony, with the tape still stuck across his mouth, smashes kid two, pinned against the blood-stained sink, with the stock of his own Ingram.\nIn the midst of this, the Toad jumps up, wounded but with strength, he tears out the motel room door hysterical, gripping the whirring chainsaw in a reflex action.\nChi-Chi, climbing through the window, fires at him.\nMeanwhile, kid two, with a rattlesnake life in him, produces\na knife out of nowhere, just missing Tony's gut by a half-second as Tony dances back, getting a grip on the machine pistol.\nHe blows kid two away point-blank, putting another ten craters in the mirror of the now-wrecked motel room.\nTony, yelling, whirls after the Toad.\nTONY\nI got him!\nManny, holding his side, empties his pistol on kid one, who is still twitching.\nChi-Chi sees Angel, gags.\nCUT TO\n46 EXT. SUN-RAY MOTEL - DAY 46\nThe senior citizens, playing Mahjong on the porch, mutter\nin astonishment, as the Toad staggers out into the parking lot, blood flying, chainsaw in hand, moving like a jerky chicken.\nTheir eyes follow.\nAs Tony comes out, walking after him deliberately, eyes set in cold fury, machine gun swinging loosely at his side.\nThere's no rush, no fear of the police, getting even is all\nthat counts. He stands behind the Toad.\nTONY\n(Spanish)\nYour turn, cabron!\nThe Toad whips around to the voice, eyes stark with terror.\nTony empties the clip into the Toad, blowing him apart.\nThe bystanders just stare, stunned by the ferocity. Then\nan old lady faints.\nThe Toad's body lying awkwardly arched in the gutter, Tony\nturns and with a passing disinterested glimpse at his\naudience, calmly walks back into the motel; the distance\nand the light sufficient to conceal Tony's possible identification.\nCUT TO\n47 EXT. SUN-RAY MOTEL - DAY\nTony intersects Manny holding his side, with Chi-Chi.\nTONY\nManny, you okay?\nManny nods.\nTONY\nChi-Chi, get the car. Fast!\nCHI-CHI\nSi!\n48 INT. TOAD'S MOTEL ROOM\nTony strides into the shambles of Room 9, past the bodies\nand busted furniture to the suitcase on the bed from which\nthe Lizard pulled the chainsaw. The TV news still plays in the corner.\nInside are several kilo-sized stacks of cocaine.\nHe shuts the suitcase, exits, stops, looks in the bathroom at the corpse of Angel off-camera. He goes, stoops, brings Angel's Change charm into our view, fingers it, tosses it back in the tub. He goes.\nCUT TO\n49 EXT. SUN-RAY MOTEL - DAY\nChi-Chi has the sedan waiting in the parking lot. Tony\nhurries out, jumps in, the car speeding off. (Pisalo hasta la tabla -- Step on it.)\nPast the senior citizens who are retreating inside their\nrooms.\nThe camera swinging to hold on the blue and black Monte Carlo disappearing into the traffic of the Strip as two cop cars\ncome screaming past them from the opposite direction.\nCUT TO\n50 EXT.

LOPEZ CONDO - NIGHT 52\nA deluxe apartment with the latest in electronic security and surveillance, and a profusion of mirrors and luxury items... and a hefty, Indian-looking bodyguard (Ernie), eyes quietly trained like a Doberman pinscher.\nThe boss, Frank Lopez, comes down a carpeted corridor, dressed for dinner in an expensive suit and shoes, somewhat preoccupied as he greets Tony, then Manny, with a phony effusion of warmth. He's of Cuban-Jewish extraction, now Americanized in a rough and handsome sort of way, on the heavy side, the face going slightly soft, but the eyes and bulk carrying an odor of danger about him.\nLOPEZ\nHow ya doing, Tony? Glad to meet you. How 'bout a drink?\nTONY\nMr. Lopez... real pleasure.\nLOPEZ\nCall me Frank, Tony. Everybody calls me Frank. My Little League team, even the prosecutors 'round town, they all call me Frank.\nTONY\nOkay Frank.\nFrank shakes hands with Manny.\nLOPEZ\nHowya doing?\nMANNY\n(awed)\n...Fine yeah.\nTONY\nManny Ray, he was with us on the job.\nLOPEZ\n(to Manny)\nI hear you caught one?\nManny shrugs, works his arm, showing us the wound doesn't bother him too much.\nMANNY\nJust the flesh. Went right through.\nLOPEZ\n(heading for the bar)\nYeah, Omar here tells me good things about you boys.\nTONY\n(glances at Omar)\nYeah. Omar's terrific.\nLOPEZ\nNot to mention of course the nice job you guys did for me on that Commie sonufabitch Emilio Rebenga.\nTONY\nYou don't have to mention it. That was fun.\nLOPEZ\n(smiles, likes the kid's balls)\nScotch? Gin? Rum?\nTONY\nGin's fine.\nLOPEZ\n(pouring)\nYeah, I need a guy with steel in his balls. I need him close to me, a guy like you Tony -- and your compadre here.\nTONY\nYeah... well.\nStill a little overwhelmed by the opulence of the place, his clothes feeling narrow and cheap on him, Tony steps forward and puts the suitcase up on the bar with the gin, which Lopez passes to him, eyeing the suitcase.\nTONY\n...that's it. That's the two keys. Angel died 'cause of this shit. And here's the money.\n(produces the money)\nIt's my gift to you -- from me.\nPause. Lopez shakes his head, sighs.\nLOPEZ\nIt's too bad about your friend, Tony, if people'd do business the right way, there'd be no fuckups like this....\nHe glances hard at Omar who squirms.\nWithout opening it, Lopez signals the bodyguard who takes\nthe suitcase and the money from under Tony's nose.\nLOPEZ\nDon't think I don't appreciate this gesture, Tony. You find in this business, you stay loyal you move up and you move up fast. Salud!\nThey drink the toast. With their eyes.\nLOPEZ\nThen you find out your biggest head ache's not bringing in the stuff but figuring out what to do with all the goddamn cash.\n(drinks)\nTONY\nYeah, I hope I have that problem someday.\nLopez looks, distracted., down the corridor from which he came, to Ernie, the bodyguard.\nLOPEZ\nWhere the hell's Elvira? Go get her, will you, Ernie?\nThe big bodyguard exits smoothly.\nLOPEZ\n(to the others)\nThe broad spends half her life dressing, the other half undressing.\nTONY\nI guess you gotta catch her in the middle, hunh?\nLopez laughs.\nLOPEZ\nYeah. When she's not looking. What do you say guys, to a little food?\n(finishes his drink at his impatient pace)\nTONY\nYeah sure, I could eat a horse.\nERNIE\nHere she comes, Mr. Lopez.\nTONY looks up, his eyes tumbling on the most beautiful blonde he's ever seen. The lady, is coming down the glassed-in elevator, adjusting her $10,000 Yves St. Laurent burgundy dinner dress.\nLOPEZ\nOooh sweetheart, you look like a million bucks.\nShe doesn't answer, her eyes flicking disinterestedly over to Tony and Manny, knowing what the evening's going to be and not too happy about it.\n**ALTERNATIVE**\nLOPEZ\nWhere you been baby, it's ten o'clock, I'm hungry.\nELVIRA\nYou're always hungry, you should try starving.\nLopez laughs.\nLOPEZ\nI want you to meet a friend of mine.\nTony Montana...

If anyone wanted to assassinate\nyou, you wouldn't be too hard to find.\nLOPEZ\n(coming toward her, laughing)\nMe? Who'd want to kill me? I got nothing but friends.\nELVIRA\nYou never know, do you? Maybe the catcher on your Little League team.\nNeatly avoiding his intended smooch, she slips by him towards the door, her throat flashing a $20,000 strip of jewelry.\nELVIRA\nCome on, Frank, let's go.\nTracking a cool, polished hauteur, she exits the apartment.\nLopez, after a pause, snaps at his men.\nLOPEZ\nOkay, let's go.\nCUT TO\n54 EXT. THE BABYLON CLUB - NIGHT\nWe know this is no workingman's dive when Lopez piles them\nout of his Rolls, and the carhops are moving Bugattis, Lamborghinis and Corniches in a long snaking line down the driveway. Single girls in high-collared silver lame jumpsuits with cinched waists, prowl like big glistening tents back and forth across the entry doors, rich young coiffed playboys in their Porsches honking their horns in appreciation. Brain drain.\n55 INT. BABYLON CLUB - NIGHT\nThe interior is built like three or four plush apartments that run together on three separate levels with imaginative angles, mirrors, swimming pool, bars, twenty-piece band, hundreds of tropical plants, dance floor, video games, computers and a restaurant. It's a lavish fun spot that will play a central role in the film, a drug dealer haven and nighttime capital of South America.\nThe crowd, a combination of Caucasian and Latin, is mostly\nyoung, rich and happy and a lot of them coked; the girls, upperclass in sleek dresses, trim figures, heels, hats, sensuous bodies, yell as they dance to a black American music beat, \"Celebrating\" or \"Partying Down Tonight\".\nThe waitresses, mostly blondes, wear little coca channel\nhats pinned to their heads and the barest pants with hose\nand high heels.\nRich young guys with a lot of gold and diamonds on their\nnecks and hands huddle briefly in groups or chat.\nDown at the vid games are younger chicks in jeans and\ntough-looking tank tops with \"Motherfuckah\" and \"Fuck Me\"\nwritten on them. Manny's coming from the toilets, tries to pick one of them up.\nMANNY\nSo whaddaya say, hunh?\nHe flashes his tongue. She looks at him, amused.\nCHICK\nYou got a buck?\nMANNY\nSure I got a buck, whaddaya think I am, poor?\nCHICK\n(indicates the machine)\nPut it in, let's play.\nMANNY\nI had other things in mind.\nCHICK\nYou check out on this and we'll talk about other things.\nMANNY\n(looks off, concerned, then confronts the complex machine)\nFuck, how do you play this thing?\nCUT TO\n56 INT. BABYLON CLUB 56\nFrank Lopez, intoxicated, takes his heart pill with a slug\nof champagne. He sits next to Tony, who is agog at all this wealth. Omar and Ernie look on. Elvira is in conversation with a girl friend who has stopped by. They're sitting at the best table in the place, finishing up a giant meal. The empty spot belongs to Manny.\nLOPEZ\n(to Tony)\nOver there that's Ronnie Echeverria.\nHim and his brother Miguel, they got a big distribution set-up here to Houston and Tucson....\nTheir point of view -- Ronnie Echevarria, powerful, competent looking man in conversation with a party of people.\nLOPEZ\nThat guy there, in the purple shirt -- Gaspar Gomez. Bad news. Stone killer there ever was one. Stay away.\nTheir point of view -- Gaspar Gomez at a table with another\nguy and gorgeous woman.\nLOPEZ\n...the fat guy, with the chicas is Nacho Contreras -- El Gordo. Wouldn't know it to look at him but he's got more cash than anybody in here. A real haza....\nTheir point of view -- El Gordo is fat, dressed like a cheap slob and playing up to a bunch of chicas.\nLOPEZ\n. ..you know what a haza is, Tony?\nTONY\n'Haza'? No Frank, what's a haza?\nLOPEZ\nIt's Yiddish for pig. It's a guy he's got more'n what he needs, so he don't fly straight anymore, y'know. That's the problem in this business, Tony, there's too many 'hazas' and they're the ones you got to watch out for. If they can fuck you outta an extra dime, they'll rip you and flip you and then fuck you with a stick for the pure pleasure of it. See it all comes down to one thing, Tony boy, never forget it! Lesson number one -- don't underestimate the other guy's greed.\nELVIRA\nLesson number two -- don't get high on your own supply.\nThe girl friend has departed and Elvira turns her attention back to them, bored.\nLOPEZ\nThat's right. Course not everybody follows the rules.\n(eyeing Elvira)\nHEAD WAITER\nThere you go, Mr. Lopez.\nHe's popped the champagne cork and pours Dom Perignon for Lopez.\nLOPEZ\nGive it to everybody and bring another, willya Jack?\nHead Waiter nods.\nLOPEZ\n(to Tony)\nFive hundred fifty dollars for this bottle Tony, what do you think of that, hunh? For a bunch of fucking grapes -- isn't that something?\nELVIRA\n(to Tony)\nIn France, it cost $100 but don't tell anybody in Miami.\nTony catches her eye. She looks away, interested.\n57 INT. BABYLON CLUB - NIGHT\nA Man passes the table. Lopez calls out.\nLOPEZ\nHey, George -- buddy.\nMAN\nHey, Frank.. -how's the case coming?\nThe Man's eyes thread the table. He looks sharp, heavy-lidded, cigarette-eyed, his voice a hoarse croak, a cigarette dangling from his mouth, his manner cool but amicable with Lopez. This is George Sheffield, Miami lawyer.\nLOPEZ\nOy, I shoulda come to you 'stead of that putz, Neufeld.\nSHEFFIELD\nJack's a good lawyer. I taught him everything he knows.\nLOPEZ\nYeah, almost everything.\nSHEFFIELD\n(to Elvira)\nElvira, you look terrific...\n(to all)\nEnjoy yourselves.\nHe ambles off.\nLOPEZ\n. . . best goddamn lawyer in Miami.

I'd like you and your boys to handle some stuff for me, Tony, work with Omar here. We're doing something big next month. Running a string of mules out of Columbia. You do good on that, there'll be other things.\nOmar doesn't like it but glances away.\nTONY\nHey, that sounds like fun, Frank. Thanks.\nThe music shifts to slow dancing.\nELVIRA\n(waving away cigar smoke)\nSo, you want to dance, Frank or you want to sit here and have a heart attack?\nLOPEZ\nDance? I'd rather have a heart attack.\nELVIRA\n(rising)\nDon't foam into the Dom Perignon.\nGlancing at Omar, sitting there obediently. Her eyes say forget it.\nELVIRA\n(to Tony)\nHow about you?\nTony nods sure, looks at his boss.\nLOPEZ\n(waves)\nGo on!\nThey go.\n58 INT. BABYLON CLUB - NIGHT\nIt's interesting to watch Tony walk to the floor, leading Elvira. It's not so much an act of walking as it is an act of war, a tank bouncing anything or anybody off that gets in the way. Be just proceeds in a straight dead line, eyes forward. It's not that he doesn't see the people he bumps off, it's that he couldn't care less.\nLOPEZ\n(to Omar)\nWhat do you think?\nOMAR\nI think he's a fucking peasant.\nLOPEZ\nYeah -- but you get guys like that on your side, they break their backs for you.\nCUT TO\n59 INT. BABYLON CLUB DANCE FLOOR - NIGHT 59\nTony and Elvira are dancing semiclose to a slow Billy Joel\ndance tune.

I'm getting a headache.\nTONY\nJust trying to be friendly.\nELVIRA\nI've got enough friends -- and I don't need another one, 'specially one who just got off the banana boat.\nHe makes a point of looking at her.\nTONY\nHey, I didn't come over on no banana boat. I'm a political refugee here.\nELVIRA\nOh, part of the Cuban crime wave?\nTony, pissed, bangs once more into the elderly couple.\nThe man stops dancing, looks at him exasperated but Tony\ndoesn't see.\nTONY\nWhatta you talking crazy for, whatsa matter with you?\nELVIRA\n(interrupting)\nI'm sorry. I didn't know you were so sensitive about your diplomatic status.\nTONY\nWhy you got this beef against the world? You got a nice face, you got great legs, you got the fancy clothes and you got this look in your eyes like you haven't been fucked good in a year.

Cars honk angrily but he couldn't give a shit.\nTONY\nCome on!\nManny follows as Tony now moves across the opposite lane, a\ncar screeching to a halt in front of him.\nTONY\n(points)\nOkay Rober Retfor, strut your stuff.\nThe blonde has paused to look in a shop window.\nManny stops alongside, -pretends to look. When he catches\nher eyes, he flicks his tongue.\nShe looks at him, confused, then back into the window.\nManny looks back at Tony, winks, sidles closer to her.\nTony, exiting off to the side, catches the gaze of a somber\nchild, four, toddling along with it's mom. He makes his\nown version of a funny face at the kid who looks back at\nhim puzzled. Tony produces another face. The kid now\nsmiles. The mother looks over. Tony shrugs. She smiles and moves along.\nMeanwhile, Manny has moved close to the blonde and suggests something, his eyebrows raising, the smile crooked. It takes a moment, then the blonde socks him across the face and walks away.\nTony walks up to him, mocking.\nTONY\nI'm telling you man you got it- all mixed up.\nThis country first, you gotta get the money; then you get the power, and when you got the power, then you get the women -- then, chico, you got the world by the balls.

TONY'S MOTHER'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT\nThe interior is comprised of small, narrow rooms filled\nwith religious objects from macumba and waist-high black\nJesus statues in various corners. The floor is without rugs and mosaicked with inexpensive, Aztec-type tiles, the impression clean, cluttered, Catholic, somewhat depressing.\nStepping forward to the center of the living room like a cautious cat is his nineteen-year-old sister Gina. Their eyes lock.\nTONY\n(moved)\nHi Gina...\nGINA\nTony?\nShe looks at her mother confused. She's a naturally dark,\ncurly-headed beauty with a slim, graceful figure and\nlarge-lidded eyes brimming with the same energy as Tony's.\n(She might also be recognizable from the snapshot we saw in\nTony's possession.)\nTONY\n(covering his unwanted emotion)\nYeah, look at you, you're beautiful... what's it been seven years?

Always.\"\nGINA\nIt's beautiful Tony, it's just beautiful....\nThe mother is amazed at the cost of the gift. Tony pulls\nout another present, for her.\nTONY\n...for you too Mama, look....\nMoving towards her, he opens the package and pulls out an\nexquisite pearl necklace. She stares at it, doesn't take it. Gina comes over, takes it for her.\nGINA\nIt's beautiful... Mama,\n(offers it, an unspoken 'why don't you take it?')\nMama doesn't. Gina puts it away with her own.\nTONY\n(holding Gina by the shoulder, making light of it)\nWell anyway, here we are hunh? The three musketeers! We made it to America hunh?

You're not going to destroy her. I don't need your money, thanks. I work for my living -- and I don't want you in this house anymore and I don't want you around Gina. So leave us alone... go on, get out! And take this lousy\nmoney with you, it stinks!\nShe casts the bundle of bills back across the table at him\nlike dead lettuce.\nA silence. Tony sits there livid, soothing his scar, about to explode, but doesn't. Gina mutters something in the silence.\nGINA\nOh Mama... why do you got to spoil it for everybody.\n(to Tony)\nI'm sorry Tony, I....\nTony nods his head at his mother.\nTONY\n(gently)\nOkay, Mama, okay....\nCUT TO\n70 EXT.

Five years, ten years, it doesn't matter how long you been away, you're my blood. Always.\nPause. She stares intently at him, emphasizing it.\nTONY\nHey I know... I know.\nShe gives him a soft kiss. He takes out his money roll.\nTONY\nSay, I want you to keep this for yourself. Okay? Help Mama out, but don't tell her I gave you this, okay?\nShe hesitates... He nudges her on the cheek and slaps the whole wad into her palm.\nTONY\nGo on! Go out and have some fun, what the hell?

She peers in.\nGINA\nYou can come by the shop y'know, any afternoon, I'll be there okay?\nHer eyes fall on Manny at the wheel.\nHe smiles back with charm.\nGina's eyes pause on him, then withdraw.

GOLF COURSE - MIAMI - DAY 86\nFrank Lopez has Tony and Chi-Chi out on the golf course. Tony never played before and gets frustrated, swings his club at the ball like a baseball bat -- Lopez getting a kick out of him. Chi-Chi naturally makes a perfect putt, shrugging when Tony looks over at him amazed.\n87 INT.

COCAINE LAB - BOLIVIA - DAY 93\nSubtitle appears:\nCOCHABAMBA, BOLIVA\nAlejandro Sosa is a playboy, about six-foot-two, black wavy\nhair, athletic body and a Copacabana tan, the clothes, a\ncasual polo shirt and the latest pants from Calvin Klein.\nOn his wrist is a flashy gold ID bracelet with \"Alex' written in diamonds and on the other wrist a gold Rolex with a bezel full of diamonds worth maybe $30,000. His eyes fizzle with an energy derived not from drugs but the continual excitement of his toys and his money.\nAccompanying him everywhere is the Shadow, a thin, intense\nvenomous-looking Hispanic man in his thirties, he has the\nlook of death in an unsmiling face. He is always in\nproximity to his Jefe, usually slightly behind the person\nor persons addressing Sosa -- in a sort of garotte\nposition, his eyes swiveling to stare down the person who\nmight glance at him. He is a continual source of tension\nunderplaying the scenes, particularly coming to affect Omar\nwho is insecure to begin with.\nSosa is showing Tony and Omar through his coke processing\nlab, past four coal-fired stoves, each with massive iron\nkettles bubbling with coca paste... across to a row of ovens\nwhere the refined coke dries. The chemists and Indians\nworking there all acknowledge llel rey de1 rey\" as he passes, as proud of his factory as a vine grower his vineyard.\nSOSA\nSo this and my other factory can guarantee production of 200\nkilos refined every month of the year. Problem is, I have no steady\nmarket. Some months I can't get rid of fifty keys, other months I have to do 2 to 300 keys, it's crazy, hunh? Nobody can run a business that way ---\nOMAR\nI know what you mean Mr. Sosa, we got the same problems up in Miami, the demand varies for us too, month to month...\nSosa looks at him like that's obvious and moves on. In his\nskinny suit, with the wet cigarette clamped between his\nnervous fingers, Omar's not quite in his league with Sosa.\nTony, awed by the scope of it all, follows along, stops to\nlook at a sample of the dried coke.\nThe Shadow stops, eyeballs him.\nTony eyeballs him back, playing a game with him, then\nsamples the coke off his thumb into his nose.\nPause. His expression says I like it. He moves on.\nThe Shadow moves with him.\nSOSA\n(meanwhile)\n...Basically what I'm looking for is somebody to share the risks with me, somebody in the States who might guarantee me something like -- say 150 kilos a month.\nOMAR\nThat's a big commitment Mr. Sosa. It's too bad Frank's not here. Something like that you should talk to him.\nSOSA\nYes, it would've been nice if he could have come.\nTONY\n(cutting in)\nand he'd like meeting you too Mr. Sosa. But with his trial coming up y'know, it's not so easy for him to slip outta the country right now, y'understand?\nSOSA\n(taking the measure of Tony, sarcastic)\nSo he sent you?\nTONY\nYeah, something like that. You sure got good stuff in there Mr. Sosa -- class A shit.\nLooking over the laboratory like it was his.\nOmar glances at him, annoyed.\nSOSA\nWe'll talk at my house. Shall we go...\nCUT TO\n94 INT. SOSA VILLA - BOLIVIA - DAY 94\nThe camera moves past a spectacular view of the mountains\nto a cavernous dining room highlighted by huge paintings\nfrom the Spanish classical period and ornate candelabra.\nAt the table are Sosa, Omar, Tony. The Shadow sits impassively in a folding chair off to the side, watching Omar and Tony. Tony is impressed, looking at the plates, the glasses, the silverware, uncomfortable, trying to fit in.\nHe eats the salmon off a silver plate with oafish movements of his knife and fork as the servants move to and fro, constantly hanging dishes, confusing Tony (ad-lib during scene).\nSOSA\n(to Omar)\n...say Lopez guarantees me 150 keys a month for a year, and he picks it up down here, I could sell it to him for as little as 7000 a kilo. You cannot do better than that.\nOMAR\nWell, we do that, we gotta take the\nrisk of moving it. Also we'd be cutting out the Columbians. You\nknow what that means?\nTONY\nThat means we gotta go to war with\n`em.\nlooks over at him, not quite knowing yet what to make\nSosa\nof this guy.\nSOSA\nWhen we cut out the Colombians we take risks -- on both sides.\nTONY\nSplit the risk. Guarantee your delivery as far as Panama.\nSOSA\nPanama? Risky? It costs me more. There I'd sell maybe 13.5 a key.\nTONY\n13.5! What are you nuts? We still gotta take the shit to Florida. You\nknow what that's like these days?\nThey got the Navy all over the fuckin' place. They got frogmen, they got EC2s with satellite tracking shit in 'em, they got fuckin' Bell 209 assault choppers up the ass, we're losing one out of every nine loads. It's no duckwalk for us anymore, y'know. Forget it.\nOmar is looking at him, ready to explode at his blithe assumption of power -- whereas Sosa chuckles, amused by his brashness, starting to be intrigued by this animal.\nSOSA\nWhat do you suggest is a fair...?\nExcuse me.\nInterrupted, Sosa looks over at his black aide who suddenly\nappears at the door, apparently with a message. Sosa waves\nhim in.\nThe black aide -- The Skull -- is a slim, tall imposing man\nwith academic, 'horn-rimmed glasses and close-cropped hair\non a huge and impressive skull. He combines the physical qualities of an animal with an intellectual. As he approaches, he glances down the table, his eyes falling briefly on Omar who doesn't connect. The Skull falters -- just for a moment -- then continues towards Sosa with the same stony, loyal expression.\nSosa lends his ear and the Skull whispers his information.\nA beat.\nHe whispers a second thought. Sosa reacts minimally.\nThen he nods, dismissing the Skull who heads out the room.\nSosa glances at his gold Rolex.\nOMAR\n(meanwhile, in a whisper to Tony)\nShaddup willya Montana, I'm doing the talking here!\nTony shrugs.\nSOSA\nWhere were we?\nTONY\nPanama. You're looking for a partner, right?\nOmar shoots a poisonous glance at Tony.\nSOSA\n...something like that.\n(chuckles)\nOMAR\nLook Mr. Sosa, we're getting ahead of ourselves here. I'm down on Frank's authority to buy 200 keys, that's it, that's my limit. I got no right to negotiate for Frank Lopez on anything larger than that. So why don't we...\nTONY\nHey Omar, why don't you let the man finish, hunh? Let him propose his proposition.\nOMAR\nHey Montana, you got no authority here, okay! I started you in this business, all right, so shut the fuck UP!\nTONY\n(shrugs)\nFrank'll love it. Don't worry about it.\nOMAR\nThat's up to Frank -- not you.\nHe looks embarrassed at Sosa who has been watching, sensing\n-- also an advantage in the split.\nOMAR\nI'm sorry about this, Mr. Sosa...\nSOSA\nIt's all right. Maybe your partner's right. Maybe you should talk to\nFrank.\nOMAR\n(a beat)\nOkay. I don't think this is something I want to do on an overseas phone, but I can go back to Miami and talk to Frank personally.\nSOSA\n(without hesitation)\nGood. My chopper can take you to Santa Cruz now. I have a jet there that'll have you in Miami in five hours.\nYou can be back here tomorrow. For lunch.\nOmar is taken aback by the speed of the plan.\nOMAR\nYeah. I guess so....\nTONY\nGreat.\nSOSA\n(glancing at Tony, to Omar)\n...leave your friend here. While you're gone maybe he can tell me how to run my business.\nOMAR\n(doesn't get it)\nI don't think that...\nTONY\n(lighting a cigar)\nHey, it's okay. You tell Frank I'm keeping this guy on ice for him...\nSosa laughs. Omar scowls.\nCUT TO\n95 EXT. SOSA VILLA - DAY 95\nThe helicopter blades whirr. The Skull waits inside with the Shadow. They both stare at:\nOmar, who, with one hesitant look, steps inside.\nThe chopper lifts off the lawn, the camera moving to the\npolo players exercising in the distance... a woman on a\nhorse rides by and we swing with her towards the villa.\nSosa walks Tony down an outside gallery towards the veranda where servants lay out the coffee and fruits.\nTONY\nYou know why they say Cubans are all screwed up?\nSOSA\nWhy?\nTONY\nCause the island's in the Caribbean, the government's in Russia, the Army's in Angola, and the people live in Miami.\nSosa laughs. They reach the veranda, Tony glancing past Sosa to an exotic-looking, dark-eyed senorita who gets off her horse, held by a servant, and joins them.\nTONY\n(overlapping the joke)\nThey got a beard there that's all. With a cigar and a big mouth.\nSOSA\nMaybe he'll move to Miami too...\nGabriella, my rose -- how was the ride?\nSosa changes his personality completely with her, dewy-eyed and loving. They peck each other's cheek lightly.\nGABRIELLA\n(distracted)\nLovely... but the sheep in the north pasture, they're destroying the grass, it's turning yellow. You must move them darling.\nSOSA\nI'll take care of it myself.\nGABRIELLA\n(turning to him)\n...and don't forget we have the Rinaldi's at eight.\nSOSA\nOf course not. Uh -- an associate of mine. From Miami. Tony Montana...\n(to Tony)\nMy fiance, Gabriella Montini.\nTONY\nHello....\nShe nods to him in that somewhat uninterested, rude, upperclass Latin way.\nGABRIELLA\nIt's a pleasure.\nShe withdraws. Tony watches her go.\nTONY\nI gotta hand it to you. You got everything a man could want.\nSosa, pleased, reaches for an expensive set of binoculars on the patio table, looks up through them, at the helicopter rising off the lawn.\nSOSA\n(focusing the binoculars)\nI like you Tony. There's no lying in you... Unfortunately I don't feel\nthe same way about the rest of your organization.\nTony glances up at the chopper, the servant pouring coffee for him.\nTONY\nIn-- l -- Whaddaya getting at, Mr. Sosa?\nSOSA\nI mean Omar Suarez.\nTony, puzzled, glances up at the chopper which now hovers there high above the estate.\nSosa passes him the binoculars.\nSOSA\nThis garbage was recognized by my associate at lunch.\nFrom several years ago, in New York. He was an informer for the police....\nTony, astonished, looks up.\n96 THROUGH THE BINOCULARS - OMAR 96\nterrified, being positioned at the door of the chopper by\nthe Shadow and the Skull, his hands tied to his back and a\nlength of thick rope looped around his neck. He is struggling backwards in vain.\nSOSA\nHe put Vito Duval and the Ramos Brothers -- Nello and Gino -- away for life. My associate used to work up there.\nThrough the binoculars -- they throw Omar out of the\nchopper and he flies downwards and jerks back up as the rope stretches taut, snapping his neck. He hangs there like a broken doll on a string as the chopper moves out of sight.\nA silence.\n97 TONY 97\nshaken, lowers the binoculars.\nSosa watches him closely for his reaction.\nTony looks back at him, contemplative.\nSosa goes over, pours himself some coffee.\nSOSA\nSo how do I know you're not a 'chivato' too Tony?\nTONY\n(awry, stalks up to him)\nHey Sosa -- get this straight right now ! I never fucked anybody over in my life didn't have it comin' to him okay! All I got's my two balls-- and my word -- and I don't break 'em. For nobody.\nThat piece of shit up there I never liked, I never trusted..\nFor all I know he's the guy who set me up and got my buddy Angel Fernandez killed.\nBut that's history. I'm here. He's not. You wanna go on with me, say it. You don't, make your move, hodedor!\nSOSA\n(moves away)\nI think you speak from the heart Montana, but I say to myself this\nLopez -- your boss -- he has 'chivatos' like that working for him, his judgment stinks. So I think to myself, what other mistakes has this Lopez guy made, how can I trust his organization...hunh? You tell me Tony.\nTONY\nHey Frank's smart. Don't blame him for that animal. It's crazy business we're in, it can happen to anybody -- even you y'know. I'll talk to Frank myself. I'll fix this thing up right between you.\n(then)\nYou got my word on that.\nSosa approaches Tony, focusing an intense stare on him,\nmakes an elaborate gesture of putting his hands out, Tony\nfollowing the pantomime, puts his out. Sosa now grips them.\nSOSA\nYou speak with your eyes muchacho. I think -- you and I -- we can work this thing out, do business a long time together. Just remember -- it's the only thing I ever tell you -- don't fuck me Tony, don't ever try to fuck me.\nTheir eyes locked together.\nCUT TO\nAERIAL VIEW - MIAMI - TWILIGHT 98\nIn all its Caribbean splendor with the long curving beach\nand rich white buildings, bathed in a lovely violet light.\nMusic theme continuing over.\nREVERSE WIPE TO\n99 EXT. LOPEZ MOTORS AUTO DEALERSHIP - LITTLE HAVANA - DAY 99\nIn long shot we see an agitated Lopez entering his dealership with his bodyguard. Against a background of used American cars without great distinction, he ad-libs his way through some customers and salesmen, shaking hands and acting like everybody's favorite uncle... 'till we see him approach Tony, who is waiting for him with Manny\noutside his office.\nHe jerks his head. Inside. They go.\nCUT TO\n100 INT. AUTO LOPEZ OFFICE - DAY 100\nThe office is highly decorated with plagues, mementos,\nCuban patriot flags, and lots of photographs, centering on\nJFK and RFK shaking the hand of Lopez who now stares\nincredulously at Tony.\nLOPEZ\n(livid)\nYou what!

Seventy-five mill! That's serious money.\nLOPEZ\nYeah and what's Sosa gonna do to me when I don't come up with the first five million dollars on this deal --send me a bill? He's gonna send hit squads up here that's what. There's gonna be war in the streets.\nTONY\nFrank... Frank...\nLOPEZ\n(ranting)\nYou know what this fucking trial is costing me in legal fees, Montana?\n...You expect me to believe Omar was a stoolie.\nCause Sosa said so? And' you bought that line?\n(pause, eyeing Tony)\nMaybe I made a mistake sending you down there? Maybe you and Sosa know something I don't know?\nTONY\nYou saying I'm not being straight with you Frank?\nLopez's bodyguard shifts. Manny slips his hand closer to his belt.\nLOPEZ\n(carefully)\nLet's just say I want things to stay the way they are. For now. Stall\nyour deal with Sosa.\nLong pause. Tony's eyes meeting Lopez's. He gave Sosa his word.\nTONY\n(finally)\n...have it your way boss.\nHe turns to leave, nods to Manny.\nLOPEZ\nMontana... just remember I am the boss.\nTONY\nSure you're the boss.\nGets to the door, Manny joining him.\nLOPEZ\nY'know I told you when you started Tony, the guys who last in this business are guys who fly straight, real low key, real quiet.. -the guys who want it all, the chicks and the champagne and the flash -- they don't last.\nTony saying nothing, goes out the door with Manny.\n101 EXT.

Manny Ray.\nManny, standing in the background, nods... Sheffield shifts his eyes\nbriefly, back to Tony who plops himself in a chair.\nTONY\nSo George, they tell me you're the best lawyer in town.\nSHEFFIELD\nDid they also tell you how expensive I am?\nTONY\nHey it's like J.P.

We tell you who's moving against you, we shake down who you want shaken down, if you have a real problem in a collection, we'll step in for you. I got eight killers with badges working for me.

I found him stoned in the jungle and there's nothing you'll ever see like him. I present with great pride, from Caracas, Venezuela -- 'Octavia' !\nLights dimming to the bluesy rhythm of the Sinatra song as\nsad-eyed Octavia suddenly appears in the shifting spot-\nlight drawing immediate laughter.\nHe is dressed as an enormously fat old man with a Quasimodo\nmask covering both the front and back of his head and neck.\nWith a red bulb for a nose, he gyrates grotesquely to the sleek song; once the mood of laughter has been established, the music suddenly shifts upbeat to \"Saturday Night Fever\" and the clown, like a butterfly from a worm, starts shedding the stuffing from his clothes, his big eyes staring out at us in theatrical melancholy.\nTony watches, sitting alone, distracted by the clown.\nMore laughter, more clothes coming off, building a tempo.\nWhen the head mask comes off, we see the gaunt handsome\nface of a young clown in white paint with the large\nblackened eyes staring without expression at the laughing\naudience.\nTony is hooked by the image, looks on.\nThe clown is down to his leotards, thin as a stick, and\npulling the girls out onto the floor to dance with him,\nbouncing around like yo-yos. Everybody is laughing, everybody is merry...\n...except Tony and the clown, weaving in and out of the\nsharpening spotlight in his white face as the act comes to\nits close, a haunting figure of mockery....\nTony, absorbed by his thoughts, is lucky this time.

Bulletproof blackout shutters whap\nacross the shattered windows.\nHe guns the Jaguar out into the lot, bullets careening off\nthe armor plating, whining against the shutters.\nTony suddenly brakes the car and reaches down and slams the\ngear shift into reverse. In an instant, his warmobile in reverse, accelerates, climbing to top speed...\nAs hitter three realizes it's too late, tries to get out of\nthere, but is overtaken and crushed by the car.\nCUT TO\n115 INT.

How's married life? Say hello to the princess for me -- okay. She's beautiful.\nSee you. Take care.\nGoing.\nTony watches, raging inside. He pulls a drawer open and reaches for a private cocaine supply. It's the first indication we have of this. As he snorts:\nTONY\nThat prick, that WASP whore.

He drinks\ncoffee, smiles a lot and bullshits -- two sordid guys who\nlook the part.\nIt's a tedious process counting a million five in twenties, it takes four/five hours; and throughout the desultory dialogue Tony, absorbed by the money, and Nick never stop the monotonous work of counting and stacking and noting the amounts.\nAt all times all four men, thoroughly aware of the large stacks on the table, move and talk gingerly although they appear casual and bored. They drink a lot of coffee.\nLUIS\n. I . yeah back then I worked in pictures\nI was in that picture down in Columbia.\nBurn, y'ever see it? ...with Marlon Brando.\nWe're good friends.

HeyI George I go another four hundred grand -- I go 800,000 dollars, okay? With that you can fix the Supreme Court, hunh?\nSHEFFIELD\nTony... the law has to prove 'beyond a reasonable doubt.' I'm an expert at raising that doubt but when you got a million three undeclared dollars staring into a videotape camera, honeybaby, it's hard to convince a jury you found it in a taxi cab.\nTony paces back and forth like a tiger, corking his fury.\nAbruptly coming to a decision, he whirls and leans across\nSheffield's desk.\nTONY\nAll right -- all right. I do the three fuckin' years but lemme tell\nyou about my law, George. It's realsimple. There's no 'reasonable doubt.'

SOSA VILLA LIVING ROOM - DAY - VIDEOTAPE - 168\nMATOS STUDY\nA \"Phil Donahue-type\" setting. A segment now in progress\nwith the \"Donahue-type\" interviewing Dr. Orlando Gutierrez.\nGutierrez is a young charismatic man, very well dressed and\npolished in a South American manner who exudes a sense of\nenormous passion.\nGUTIERREZ\nMore than 10,000 of our people are being tortured and held without trial. In the past two years, another 6,000 have simply disappeared. And your government -- what does it do? It\nsells my government tanks, planes, guns, but not a word -- not-a whisper-- about human rights!\nINTERVIEWER\nI've heard whispers, Doctor Gutierrez, about the financial support your government receives from the drug industry in Bolivia.\nGUTIERREZ\nThe irony, of course, is that this money -- which is in the billions,\nJim - - is coming from your country. You are the major purchaser of our national product -- which of course is cocaine.\nINTERVIEWER\nSo what you're saying Doctor Gutierrez is the United States Government is spending millions of dollars to eliminate the flow of drugs into our streets and at the same time is doing business with the very same government that floods those' streets with cocaine... that's a bit like robbing Peter to pay Paul, isn't it?\nGUTIERREZ\n(laughs)\nLet me show you some of the other characters in the comedy, Jim... my organization just recently traced a purchase by this man --\nGutierrez holds up a photograph -- insert the face on the TV\nscreen, dour, ruthless.\nGUTIERREZ\n. . . here he is, the charming face belongs to General Cucombre, the Defense Minister of my country. Two months ago he bought a twelve million dollar villa on-Lake Lucerne in Switzerland.\nNow if he's supposed to be the Bolivian Defense Minister, what's he doing living in Switzerland? Guarding the cash register?\nLaughter.\n169 TONY 169\nwatching, touching his nose a lot, blowing it, hyped from\nthe coke usage.\nSOSA\nA Communist -- financed by Moscow.\n170 GUTIERREZ 170\nholds up another photograph -- insert the face on the\nTV screen.\nGUTIERREZ\n...this is Alejandro Sosa. Interesting character. A wealthy landowner. Educated in England. Good family. The business brain and drug overlord of an empire stretching across the Andes. Not your ordinary drug dealer....\nINTERVIEWER\nWhat are you suggesting we do about this, Doctor?\nGUTIERREZ\n(passionate)\nThe United States Government has to stop supporting these fascist gangsters that are running my country, that is what your country has to do. You have to set a strong example by calling for the observation of fundamental human rights.\n171 TONY 171\nstaring intently at him, reluctantly impressed.\nGUTIERREZ\nYou Americans have no idea how important your country is as a\nsymbol and a bastion of those rights. You have no....\nSosa flips off the television. The lights come on. He's alone with Tony.\nSOSA\n...he's scheduled next for 60 Minutes. He's going on French, British, Italian, Japanese television. People everywhere are starting to listen to him. He's embarrassing, Tony...\nThat's our problem.\nTONY\nYeah.\nSosa looks up.\nThe Shadow (seen before at the disposal of Omar) comes into\nthe room, thin and quiet, his venomous eyes flicking over\nTony. The Skull leads him in.\nSOSA\nYou've met Alberto before?...\nTONY\n(remains seated)\nSure. How could I forget?\nSOSA\nAlberto, you know Tony Montana -- my partner from Florida.\nAlberto nods icily, remains standing adjacent.\nSOSA\n(to Tony)\nSo you see Alberto here is going to help fix our problem. Alberto, you know, is an expert in the disposal business -- but he doesn't know his way around the States too well, he doesn't speak English, and he needs a little help...\n(*en)\nIs that a problem, Tony?\nTony looks around the faces, then:\nTONY\nThat's no problem, Alex....\nAlex nods, pleased.\nHold on Tony. He blows his nose again.\nCUT TO\n175 INT. THE RESTAURANT - MIAMI - NIGHT\nA millionaire's place, like \"The Forge\" on Arthur Godfrey\nRoad. Tony, Elvira, and Manny are shown to their table by the maitre d'. Tony, a little loaded, intersects a group of people at another table and stops, putting his hand on a heavyset man's shoulder.\nTONY\nHey, Vic, I watch your show everyday.\nVic -- who we saw before editorializing on television.--\ncranes his leonine white head of hair around with a\npatrician annoyance reserved for bores in restaurants.\nVIC\nOh, is that so?\nTONY\nYeah. Hey, you know that two hundred kilo DEA bust you was congratulating the cops for on the toob the other night?\nVIC\nAren't you... Tony Montana?\nTONY\n(beaming now, ignoring Manny who comes to retrieve him)\nYeah, that's me.\nThe half-dozen rich people in the dinner party are intrigued.\nTONY\n(waves to them)\nHi folks, don't get up. Anyway, Vic, check it out. I heard like it was 220 kilos went down. That means twenty is missing, right? Ask your friends, the cops, about that -- and keep up the good work, Vie, but don't believe everything you hear, y'know what I mean? Okay, have a good dinner, nice to meet you people.\nWaves farewell to them, pats Vic once more on the shoulder, and leaves them murmuring.\nMANNY\n(reproving)\nHey, Tony, that's not cool, he's got a lotta friends in....\nTONY\nI don't give a fuck. He's an ass-hole! Never fucking tells the truth on TV! That's the trouble in this country. Nobody fucking tells the truth!\nNot caring if he's overheard, Tony seems to be in the grip\nof an anguish he does not understand.\nCUT TO\n173 TONY\nsits with Manny and Elvira, who is dipping into a vial of coke in the purse in her lap. Another huge meal is being consumed, the best roast beef, bottles of red and white wine, cigars....\nMANNY\nSo what's the big mystery, what happened down there with Sosa?\nTONY\nLot of bullshit, that's what. Politics.\nThe whole world's turning into politics.\nHe pulls out his own vial under the table between eating and drinking.\nMANNY\nThe one thing we always stayed out of was politics, Tony.\nTONY\nYeah, so what do you think Emilio Rebenga was? Politics or what?\nManny remembers.\nTONY\nNo free rides in this world, kid.\nMANNY\nSo who's this guy you brought back with you, the guy who don't blink?\nELVIRA\nWhat guy?\nTONY\n(to Manny)\nYou stay out of it. Run things down here. I'll be up in New York next week.\nHe takes a hit, unnoticed.\nELVIRA\n(unheard)\nWhat guy?\nMANNY\n(to Tony)\nI don't like it.\nTONY\nYou don't like it! It was you got me into this mess in the first place with that fuckin' Seidelbaum!\nWhat's Seidelbaum got to do with this?\nTony sighs, turning his attention to Elvira. He surveys the\ntable with the bored satiety of a Roman Emperor, points to\nElvira's untouched plate.\nTONY\nWhy don't you eat your food, what's\nwrong with it?\nELVIRA\nI'm not hungry.\nShe quickly does one nostril with a quick, practiced move-\nment of her hand.\nTONY\nSo what'd you order it for?\nELVIRA\nI lost my appetite.\nShe does the other nostril. Tony looking at her. One beat.\nTwo beats. He passes a silent burp.\nMANNY\n(trying to shift the mood)\nSo what about the trial? I heard Sheffield thinks he can get a new postponement....\nTony, bleary-eyed now and drunk, continues to look at Elvira, then away, encompassing the restaurant.\nTONY\n(ignoring the question)\nIs this it? Is that what it's all about, Manny?\nEating, drinking, snorting, fucking? Then what?\nYou're fifty and you got a bag for a belly and tits with hair on 'em and your liver's got spots and you're looking like these rich fuckin' mummies in here?\nIs that what it's all about?\nMANNY\nIt's not so bad Tony, could be worse....\nTONY\n(doesn't hear)\n. . . is that what I worked 'for? With these hands? Is that what I killed for? For this?\n(turns his gaze stonily on Elvira)\nA junkie??? I gotta fucking junkie for a wife? Who never eats nothing, who wakes up with a quaalude, who sleeps all day with black shades on, who won't fuck me cause she's in a coma!\nMANNY\n(gently)\nTony, you're drunk.\nTONY\n...is this how it ends? And I thought I was a winner? Fuck it\nman, I can't even have a fucking kid with her, her womb's so polluted, I can't even have a fucking little baby!\nElvira reacts -- wanting to kill. She gets up and dumps\nher plate filled with food on him. Slop drips all over him.\nELVIRA\nYou sonufabitch! You fuck!\nThey got a black tie audience now. The waiter tipping\naround to clean up the mess. Tony slowly wiping the food\noff himself.\nELVIRA\nHow dare you talk to me like that!\nYou call yourself a man! What makes you so much better than me, what do you do? Deal drugs? Kill people?\nOh that's just wonderful Tony -- a real contribution to human history. You want a kid. What kind of father do you think you'd make, Tony? What kind of stories are you going to tell the kid before he goes to sleep at night? You going to drive him to school in the mornings, Tony? You really think you're still going to be alive by the time he goes to school, Tony? You're dreaming, Tony, you're dreaming!\nThe audience is hushed, involved, the camera moving over\nthe faces of Vie and his rich friends.\nTony acidly quiet, looks around at the people, back to her.\nTONY\nSit down before I kill you.\nELVIRA\n. . . You think of yourself as a husband, too, Tony. But did you ever stay home without having six of your goons\naround all the time? I have Nick the Pig as a friend? What kind of life is that Tony? What kind of life is that?\n(in a softer tone)\nOh Tony don't you see? Don't you see what we've become? We're losers, honey, we're not winners, we're losers...\nSilence. Tony's fury has passed. So has Elvira's. There's\nthis awkwardness all of a sudden like two actors who forgot\ntheir lines.\nTONY\n(softly)\nGo on, get a cab home, you're stoned.\n(to Manny)\nManny.\nELVIRA\nNo, I'm not stoned Tony. You're stoned. You're so stoned you don't\neven know it.\nTONY\nAll right I'm stoned.\nMANNY\n(rising, trying to put his arm on Elvira)\nCome on, baby.\nELVIRA\nNo, no you stay right there Manny, I'm not going home with you... I'm not going home with anybody. I'm going home alone...\n(staring at Tony)\nI'm leaving you. I don't need this shit anymore.\nPause. She starts wobbling out.\nPast the silent spectators, their eyes moving between her and Tony. Manny rises to follow.\nTONY\nLet her go! ...Another Quaalude and she'll love me again.\nStumbling once, Elvira disappears out the door.\nTony's eyes follow her. Pause.\nThe whole room is watching him sitting there covered with\nfood, the silence cathedral. He stands, wiping at the food\nand throwing several hundred dollar bills on the table,\nthen looks up angrily at the staring millionaires.\nTONY\nYou're all assholes. You know why?\nCause none of you got the guts to be what you want to be.\nHe wobbles against the table. Manny tries to help. Tony\nshakes him loose.\nTONY\nYou need people like me so you can point your fingers and say 'hey there's the bad guy!' So what does that make you? Good guys? Don't kid yourselves. You're no better'n me. You just know how to hide -- and how to lie. Me, I don't have that problem. I always tell the truth -- even when I lie.\nHe starts out, staggers.\nTONY\nSo say good night to the bad guy...\nYou're never gonna see a bad guy like me again.\nHe walks out, proud, Manny bringing up the rear. The room\nis empty for a beat -- an extended beat, the stage without\nits star -- and then the audience begins to buzz with horror\nand delight.\nCUT TO\n174 EXT.

With subtly inexorable music, the\ncamera frames and moves on the bomb -- wired, soldered,\ntaped -- a malignant centipede in the long agile fingers of\nthe Shadow, who delicately presses a tester. A glass button on the bomb now flashes red at soothing intervals as the Shadow winds a roll of black tape from the bomb to an\naxle of the car.\n177 ERNIE\nsignals.\n178 TONY\nsees it.\nA cop car comes cruising off the avenue up the street,\ntowards us.\nGround level -- the Shadow continues to wind his black tape trying to secure the bomb as tight as possible.\nTony hurries to the car, bends down.\nTONY\n(Spanish)\nPsst!

Inside a wistful Billy Joel song plays over the stereo. He rings a buzzer, waits.\nHold the pause. The door opens casually. Standing there is Manny -- with a towel around his waist.\nMANNY\n(surprised)\nTony?\nTony stares, stunned.\nGina now comes into view behind Manny -- in a bathrobe, a\nbig smile of welcome for her brother.\nGINA\nTony!\n(eyes suddenly moving downward in alarm)\nTony with his Beretta pointed at Manny, his expression filled with loathing.\nManny smiles easily and shrugs, the gesture drawing Tony over the edge.\nMANNY\nHey Tony, c'mon we was....\nThe gun fires.\nGINA\nTony!

We gotta get out of here\n(to Gina)\nCome on baby...Gina!\nSuddenly she goes berserk.\nGINA\nNoooooooooooo!\nAnd shoving Chi-Chi aside, launches herself on Tony, screaming incoherently like a madwoman, trying to kill him. She beats him around the head, the chest, scratches furrows of flesh from his face. He stands there, oblivious, numbed.\nChi-Chi and Ernie have a demon on their hands. They manage at last to yank her off Tony, kicking and continuing to scream.\n220 EXT.

Put her upstairs.\nPut her in my bedroom.\n(to Gina)\nIt'll be all right, pussycat, you'll see everything'11 be okay, I'll take\ncare of you....\nShe looks up at him through her stupor and spits in his face. Chi-Chi and Ernie pull her away -- as Tony stares, upset but passive.\nThey trundle her up the stairs. Tony turns and walks away.\n224 INT. TONY'S OFFICE - NIGHT 224\nTony slumps on his couch. A haze of coke rises off the velvet like a snow scene painting on a Christmas card.\nOblivious to the dust, he cuts open a fresh plastic kilo bag of coke and spreads the entire pound out across the black marble coffee table.\nErnie and Chi-Chi come in.\nCHI-CHI\nWe got some pills into her, she's cooling down.\nTony pays no attention, Ernie and Chi-Chi noticing the pile of coke.\nFlashing his silver tooter, Tony snorts a truly giant amount in a large pendular swing of his elbow across the length of coffee table.\nPause as he lets it sink in.\nCHI-CHI\n(worried)\nBoss, what we gonna do now?\nTONY\nDo?

TONY'S MANSION GROUNDS - LATER THAT NIGHT 225\nThe Bengal tiger paces his spot, restless.\nA monsoon-like wind blows through the trees on the estate.\nThe monkeys listen quietly.\nThe flamingoes flutter.\n. . . Then there's a burst of loud music from the stereo speakers on the balcony -- a Billy Joel song, something smooth and easy about the high times and how fast they go...\n. . . and we see Tony, in long shot, throw open the terrace doors and stagger out onto the balcony, overlooking his estate.\n. . . On a closer angle, we track him to the edge of the\nbalustrade. He's done so much coke now he's practically\ncatatonic; staggering and muttering to himself.\nTONY\n(insensate)\n. . . Jesus fuckin' Christ whatsa matter with me, get a hold of y'self now these cocksuckers gonna run over you, let 'em try, I bury the cocksuckers....\nHis point of view -- panning his estate. The dark emptiness echoes back at him. The wind rustling the treetops.\nTony shaking his head at himself, he starts to cry!\nTONY\n...Ooooh fuck Manny, how the fuck did I do that? How the fuck! ...oh Manny, Manny ...you were there for me, you were the one, Manny, you understood, always understood...\nWell what the hell happened, hunh?\nWhat the hell happened to us?...\nIn far background. now, behind Tony, on the video monitors in his office we see:\nThe main gate and guard shack -- a Marielito crosses into view, checks the gate, turns. Suddenly two figures spring\nout at him. One of them garrotting the Marielito. He struggles.\nAnother monitor now reveals two more figures moving into\nthe interior of the guard shack. They knife the other Marielito.\nA third monitor carries another image of shadows moving\nthrough the trees on the estate.\nOn the balcony, Tony is oblivious to it all, spent, almost\nincoherent.\nTONY\n...I said to you, Manny, I said I never go crazy and you said, I would\nyou sonofabitch and you was right... those were the good days hunh, we was crazy back in those days, we'd do anything, you and me, we was on the way up, nobody nothing coulda stopped us cause we were the best hunh -- the fucking best...\nAs Tony turns and starts back through the terrace doors into his study, the camera glides around to a view of a hook flying up and catching the balustrade. A shadow starts climbing up as:\nTONY\n...we still are Manny, we still are-- see, I'm gonna wipe out all them fuckers out there, I'm gonna run the market, I'm gonna be King Cocaine you hear me, you buy, you buy from me -- Tony Montana. Covers of all the magazines. Fan mail. Television stars, movie stars, shooting stars -- he's a star....\n226 INT. TONY'S MANSION - OFFICE 226\nAs he crosses into his office, the camera moves to reveal Gina standing there half-dressed in the doorway, her eyes blazing with hatred.\nTony sees her.\nShe steps forward, offering her body almost naked to her\nbrother.\nGINA\nIs this what you want Tony?...\nTony shocked.\nGINA\nYou can't stand another man touching me. So you want me Tony, is that it? Well here I am.\nShe fires the Baretta we now see in her hand.\nThe bullet grazes Tony in the leg, snapping him from his catatonia as he goes reeling across the floor behind his desk. She fires again. Again.\nGINA\nI'm all yours Tony, I'm all yours now.\nBullets ripping into the desk. She advances, offering her sex, methodically shooting out the clip at rhythmic intervals.\nGINA\nCome and get me Tony. Before it's too late.\nHe spins across the run away from the desk, trying to put\ndistance between them. She sees him scurrying,. turns, an\nexpression like a demented angel.\nGINA\nCome on Tony, fuck me! Fuck me! Fuck me!\nAdvancing on him, firing. The furniture tearing up, the chair\nspilling, television sets and computer toys shattering, Tony\nsquirming away, hit again in the thigh, shocked, scrambling\nover to the terrace windows. Her next shot shatters the window and as Tony ducks again to the side, we see outside onto the terrace behind him:\nA young Columbian punk no more than twenty -- one of the\nhitters -- is crouched there, reacting to the broken window.\nHe doesn't hesitate, turning his machine gun on Gina.\nGina is torn to pieces by the firepower -- blown across the\nroom, spine severed and dead before she hits the floor.\nTony sees it, yells something, in the same instant swivels to knock the barrel of the machine gun aside.\nThe punk is taken by surprise, not having seen Tony, and Tony now runs him backwards across the balcony and hurls him over the balustrade.\nThe punk lands in one of the shallow pools on the grounds\nat the base of the balcony.\nTony, from above, grabs up the punk's machine gun and\nempties the whole clip into the figure thrashing in the pool below.\nErnie runs into view on the far side of the pool, spots Tony, yells up ---\nERNIE\nGet outta here!\nTony, they're everywhere!\nErnie suddenly wheels, hit in the face, by a burst of silencer bullets.\nWe catch a brief glimpse of Sosa's black aide, the Skull,\nmoving quickly along the wall of the house -- directly\nunderneath the balcony on which Tony stands.\nTony, tossing the empty machine gun aside, wildly runs back\ninto his office to get more guns, crosses to Gina corpse.\nIt takes him by surprise. He comes to a dead stop, kneels, looking questioningly in her face.\nTONY\n(gently)\nHey Gina come on, you still angry at me? I didn't mean to kill Manny, I was... I was.\nRunning his hands along her face, trying to rouse her, gently lifting her eyelids. Blood's running out of her mouth in rivers.\nTONY tx:\nCome on Gina, get off the floor.\nYou're all dirty now, you need a bath...\nMami's gonna be angry baby\n-- ooh is she gonna be mad at me!..\nCome on open your eyes my baby,\nopen your eyes.. -give me a smile.\nThere's been a steady pounding and calling now on the door of the office. Tony finally hears it, looks up, then over at the monitors.\nOne of them reveals Chi-Chi standing there outside the door\npounding it.\nCHI-CHI\nBoss ! Hey boss. Open up!\nOn the monitor we see Chi-Chi suddenly spin and open fire\ndown into the foyer. Return fire decimates him. A grenade\ngoes off, blows him up against the door.\nTONY\nCheeee!\nHe now seems to come out of his catatonia, runs to his\nsideboard, hauls out a rocket shoulder-fired rocket launcher and straps an Uzi across his shoulder. He looks up at the monitor.\nOn the monitors, the hitters are now darting across the\nfoyer and coming up the left and right hand stairs.\nThree of them are already huddled outside the door, around\nthe corpse of Chi-Chi, motioning to-each other, laying a grenade at the base of the door to blow it out.\nTony loading his rocket, intends to beat them to the punch,\ntalking to himself.\nTONY\nSo you wanna play hunh, say hello to my little friend here.\nKarroooomph!\nThe rocket tears down the door and blows the Columbian punks off the landing into the foyer.\nIt sounds like Armageddon, one of the hitters screaming, smoke billowing wildly.\nTony, at the height of his mad glory, steps out at the apex\nof the stairs, firing his machine gun and yelling.\nTONY\nWhores! Cowards! You think you can kill me with lousy bullets hunh?\nAnother hitter tumbles down the right-hand stair.\nTONY\nWho you think I am? I kill all you fuckin' assholes. I take you all to fuckin' hell!\nAnother hitter drops, screaming, off the stairs into the pool below.\nA grenade goes off. Tony is hit again, but keeps on firing\naway. Laughing like a madman.\nTONY\nYou need an army you hear! An army to kill me!\nBehind him we see the remainder of the pound of cocaine go\nup in a burst of wind, whipping around the office in auras of white.

true king of the genre.\n\nThrough an extended metaphor, the song relates the microphone (a… \nRead More\n \nIt all starts back in Italy, actually in Sicily\nA sad symphony in the early Twentieth Century\nA dark peasant boy named Benito Raphioni\nIn the barn with the ponies and leftover macaroni\nBut the lack of bread left him hungry when he's back in bed\nSo he racked his head dreamin' of what he could have instead\nWalkin' around his village, never askin' for sympathy\nAnd the lack of affinity had him practice divinity\n'Till he had an epiphany and he gathered his misery\nPacked it in a tiny bag and then he scattered from Italy\nWoulda traveled it differently, had he had the ability\nBut without a penny, Benny couldn't travel efficiently\nGatherin' his scraps, bought a third class to Manhattan\nPacked with the packages of the passengers in the cabin\nGreeted by the Lady of political Liberty\nCity imagery of vividly livin' in Little Italy\nEntered Ellis Island with only a small sac\nHis skin so dark, they thought he was all black\nTook the I's out of his name, Benito couldn't complain\nRaphioni or Raphone, to him it was all the same\nHe just wanted money so he started workin' at the docks\nBut could only make enough for a little place in the Bronx\nA diligent immigrant in a primitive tenement\nWith the skill of a city citizen bringin' in dividends\nNow he's livin' with benefits and it opened his mind\nSo he's hopin' to find his utopian bride\nBenito opened his eyes to a beautiful black queen\nNo longer was she broke and deprived\nOn the way to top class, 'till the morning she woke with a hot flash\nCash from the dock stash stopped fast when the stock crashed\nBenito contemplatin' robbery and slaughter\nThat's what happens when you mixin' the milk with the tap water\nPerverted by the Dirty Thirties\nHe heard of murder but assertively averted juries\n'Cause he would rather have a family at home, didn't plan to be alone\nSo they had a little boy named Anthony Raphone\nAnd Anthony had grown dark like his poppa is\nHangin' on the street corners of Metropolis\nHe was proud of his heritage but his dad's music had to go\nMad dudes would rock the show – jazz, blues and rock & roll\nSo he would hit the nightclubs and reside inside\nComin' eye to eye with this pretty little Irish bride\nMovin' in together unexpectedly\nHad a little baby girl in the early seventies\nLast name Raphone, first name Michelle\nIt ain't hard to tell, yo \nher name should ring a bell\nI said last name Raphone, first name Michelle\n\"It ain't hard to tell\"\n\nIn a black neighborhood back then when they hate the Irish\nMichelle was called a \nmic\n but was never afraid to hide it\nWhere you come from, there's nothing they can do to disparage it\nYo especially when you carry a beautiful heritage\nThis is strictly allegorical, the race is no concern to me\nThe story's metaphorical, emphasis on diversity\nEmphasis on the poverty, and makin' it through\nAll of the places that dedication is takin' you to\nAnd so, as Michelle grew, it would only take some time\nA proper way to find the \n\"N.Y. state of mind\"\nShe was hangin' with the hip-hop heads and all of the thugs\nMichelle flows with shell toes inside of a club\nStayed connected to the turntables\nEven though she was a tomboy, she was always the life of the night\nBut her friends never thought her name was an accurate label\nAnd so everybody started callin' her Mikey or \nMike\nBut despite the masculinity, her virtuous virginity\nWould eventually mingle its way into her identity\nAnd by the time that Mikey was nineteen\nShe had become a woman – no – matter fact a queen\nPsychedelic rays, an amazin' way with men\nWith intelligence, benevolence, and beauty in the perfect blend\nIf you were stressed or you ever felt depressed\nYou would go and talk to Mikey and she would help you express (yes)\nGradually became a symbol in the rap community\nEvery single rapper wanted her, even including me\nAnd she was older, but still I wanted to hold her\nAnd hopefully be the soldier that's standin' over her shoulder\nBut hope isn't always noble enough when movin' a boulder\nIf you was in my position then tell me what you'd have told her\nIn order to win her over, all I wanted was a taste\nFace to face, ready to embrace\n\nAnd I would always see her in my dreams, she was slippin' in my bed\nDiminishin' inhibition the minute she's in my head\nWith Nag Champa burnin,' we're kickin' it like karate\nMy hand would be at peace when it was wrapped around her body\nPerfectly curved, her skin shiny and black\nWith a tattoo on her back that said RadioShack\nI would play an instrumental and read her my poetry\nAnd if she liked what I was sayin' then she would come close to me\nRight in front of my lips, now we're ready to kiss\nThe room was fillin' up with a mist\nSuddenly the connection was made, and I was drained of my energy\nSo I burst and I gave her everything inside of me\nWe even had a child in one of my other dreams\nA beautiful baby girl that I named Harmony\nHarmony Dussolliet, and if you translate the name\nHarmony of the Sun is the creation that I made\nBut eventually I'd awake, and no longer could I reach her\nA pain that was burnin' my body like it was \n\"ether\"\nAnd everywhere she went, Mike was always adored\nYo they even have her picture on the cover of The Source\nAnd her name is comin' up in songs like all the time\nBut out of this long list, only one comes to mind\nIt was this one song where the chorus was like…\n\"All I need is one mic\"\nBut like I said in the beginnin' yo this song that I been singin'\nIs a tragedy, so naturally it has a tragic endin'\nAnd I was so concerned with it when I learned that it happened\nSo it's
