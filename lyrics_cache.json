We move to the eyes, pure in their fury. Finally we\nencompass the face -- the face of a man about to explode --\nmuscle, tissue, brain -- a man willing to live or die and\non the increment of a moment, inflict or receive either one.\nHe is clothed in rags crossed with holes, his shoes broken\ncardboard, his hair unkempt, his complexion sallow from\nprison.\nOver this:\nVOICE #1 (o.s.)\nOkay so what do you call yourself?\n\nVOICE #2 (o.s.)\nComo se llama?\nMONTANA\nTony Montana...you?\nVOICE #1\nWhere'd you learn to speak the English, Tony?\nMONTANA\nMy old man -- he was American.

No way.\nWe now reveal three men in civilian clothing in the dark afternoon light of the little room. Actually it's a plywood office somewhere in the processing hall and we hear the din from the hall over the question and answer. Two of the men sit around a desk, the Third Man stands in a corner, staring at Tony, the most authoritative-looking of the three.\nMAN #l\n(checking off a list)\nYou been in a mental hospital, Tony?\nTONY\n(grinning)\nYeah, in the boat coming over.\nMAN #1\nHow 'bout homosexuality, Tony?

Vagrancy? Marijuana?\nTONY\nNO. ...NO. Never. Nothing.\nHis eye movements are rapid (over shoulders, sides, doors)\nand he does a lot of touching -- objects -- lightly with the\ntips of the fingers.

You should see the other kid.\n(a grim chuckle)\nMAN #3\nAnd this?\nHe holds up Tony's hand and indicates the tattoo between the\nthumb and second finger -- a heart with the word \"Madre\"\nscaled through it.\nTONY\nOh that was for my sweetheart.\nMAN #3\nSweetheart?\n(to the other men)\nWe been seeing more and more of these. It's some kinda code these guys used in the can. Pitchfork means an assassin\nor something. This one's new...

Big deal.\nMAN #3\nThat's pretty funny, Tony.\nTONY\nSome Canadian tourist....\nMAN #3\nWhat'd you mug him first?

You a Communist or something?\nHow would you like it they tell you all the time what to think, what to do, you wanna be like a sheep, like everybody else. Baa baa? Puta!

Hey, I'm no little whore, I'm no stinking thief! I'm Tony Montana and I'm a political prisoner here from Cuba and I want my fucking 'Human Rights' just like President Jimmy Carter says, okay?\nSilence.\nThere's a certain eloquence to the man`s plea but\nit falls on disbelieving ears. One of them chuckles.\nMAN #l\nCarter should see this human right. He's good. He's very good. What do you say Harry?\nMAN #3\n(walking out)\nI... 'Freedomtown.' Let them take a look at him. A long look.\nTONY\nHey, that's okay, too, Harry. No hard feelings.\nMan #3 at the door stops, looks back.\nTONY\nSend me here, send me there. This.\nThat.

He takes the Baby Ruth out\nof Manny's hand, peels out the bar of chocolate, then\nreturns the empty wrapper to Manny,\nTONY\nSo what'd you tell them?\nMANNY\nI told them what you told me to tell them. I told them I was in sanitation in Cuba.\nTONY\nI didn't tell you sanitation. I told you to tell them you was in a sanitarium, not sanitation.\nThe bus pulling out now.\nMANNY\nIs that what you told me?

Conscience.\nIf you believe you've got a conscience, it`ll pester you to death. But if you don't believe you've got one, what can it do to you?

Hunh? Like me....\nHe hunches, darting exaggerated looks over his shoulder,\nimitating Bogart. Manny laughs. In his black shirt with\nzig-zag dots and colors and the baggy pants and sunglasses,\nTony's starting to look American. He's even got himself a\npop button pinned to his shirt that says \"Fuck Off and Die.\"\nAnd his English rolls faster off his tongue, his confidence\nmore pronounced.\nTONY\n. . . don't trust nobody.\nMANNY\nYeah all that gold, hunh -- I guess you get so crazy you never trust nobody no more.\nTONY\nNever happen to me, Chico.

Tony stares at it, his mind drifting as the phone\nrings in a distant place. A brief moment of repose we have\nnot yet seen in Tony.\nSomeone picks up the phone. An older woman's Voice. His\nexpression alters to uncertainty.\nVOICE\nYes? ...Hello? ...Who is this?\nTony changes his mind, hangs up. Pause. The faces of those\nin line peer in, the next party raps on the door, but Tony\nignores it, slips the snapshot back into the wallet in his\npants, then at his own pace, exits the phone booth.\nHe walks a few beats, his eyes pensive. Then recognizes\nsomebody in another phone booth and goes over.\nAngel Fernandez has got the face of one, as he argues on\nthe phone, then hangs up, a desolate look on his face, a\nworn phone book in his hand.\nTONY\nAngel, how ya doin'?\nANGEL\nYou know how many goddamn Fernandezes are living in fucking Union City?

Lookit those tits man, she's begging for it!\nAt the curb, an old crone hunchbacks her way in front of the teenage chick, who is coming off the beach in a bikini, blocking her off.\nCHI-CHI\n(looking over)\nWhatta you crazy? She's 103 years old.\nMANNY\nNot her stupido! Her....\nCamera revealing the teenager.\nTONY\n(the light changing)\nDrive, willya.\nMANNY\n(mocking)\nSure, sure. Not to worry, Tony -- You get a heart attack.\n(looking in the rearview mirror)\nAngel, whatcha wearing the face for?\nANGEL\n(tense, making light of it)\nAh, it's okay. I just y'know forgot to make an offering. I was supposed to go by the madrina today.\nMANNY\nYou still going to that cuncha?\nANGEL\nShe knows her shit. She talks to Yemaya and Chango like nobody y'ever heard.\nAs he talks Angel fingers a Negrita charm hanging around\nhis neck -- Chango, God of Fire and Thunder, his black face\ntilted at a carnal angle. Sharp teeth glinting, his eyes\nrolling in orgasmic imagery, his head crowned with gold.\nMany of the Marielitos in the film will be wearing this,\nalso pendants with an eye to ward off the evil spirits, red\nand white beads, red kerchiefs, black hand charms silver-\nbangled bracelets, etc., all relating to their Afro-Catholic\nspiritualism.\nMANNY\n(making fun)\nYeah, Chango looking out for us,\nCHI-CHI\nAngel?\nANGEL\nChango looking out for all the 'bandidos' everywhere. But you gotta pay him his dues, y'know. You gotta let him know you respect him. You don't, Chango -- he gets pissed an'...\nTONY\n(angry)\nHey, shaddup -- all of ya! I told you before I don't go for that mystical voodoo shit. That's for the old cunchas waving their rooster cocks in some dark alley, There's no gods, there's no Chango -- nowhere! You make your own luck. So shaddup and act like you're in the United States here.\nSilence. Through the windshield, the sign of a motel -- THE SUN RAY -- is coming closer.\nTONY\nOkay, this is it. Pull over across the street.\nThe motel is coming closer in silence.\nTONY\n(to Manny)\nMoney stays in the trunk till I come out and get it. Me. Nobody else. If I'm not out in fifteen minutes, something's wrong. I'm in Room 9. You ready, Angelito?\nANGEL\nSure thing.\nAs Manny pulls the car up, they pull out Ingram Model-10\nmachine pistol with folding butt and suppressor, ten inches\nof kill power capable of firing 1100 rounds a minute -- it\ncan be slipped into a man's purse, it's in vogue. Tony getting out, to Angel:\nTONY\nLet's go....\nCUT TO\n33 EXT. SUN-RAY MOTEL - DAY\nTony and Angel come slowly, gingerly down an exterior\ncorridor to a room marked \"9\". Nodding to Angel who remains in the stairwell with the Ingram machine pistol, Tony knocks.\nPause.\n34 EXT. TOAD'S MOTEL ROOM - DAY\nThe door's opened casually by an ugly, squat five-foot-four-inch Colombian, \"The Toad\". He's in his forties, sports shirt hanging over his polyester pants, old acne scars on his face, like Omar; he's good natured, a nice guy, he smiles.\nTOAD\nHey, oye amigo....\nSpreading his arms in such a fashion to indicate he's clean.\n35 INT. TOAD'S MOTEL ROOM - DAY\nTony, stepping into the conventionally tasteless orange and\nblue motel room (with heavy blue drapes blocking the windows), spreads his hands in a similar posture indicating he too is not carrying; but this is only symbolic, it's not meant to be a body search.\nTONY\n(as he steps in)\nHow you doing amigo...?\nThe other person in the room is a tough-looking little dark\nColombian chick with expressionless eyes, red fingernails, and short boy-cut hair, \"The Lizard\"; she's tinier than the Toad, about five-two.\nThe Toad looks around the corridor, eases the door closed.\nTONY\n(checking out the room)\nMind leaving the door open so my brothers know everything's okay... okay?\nToad shrugs and readjusts, leaving it open a few inches,\nthe conversation clipped and nervous throughout the scene.\nTOAD\nSure, no problem... This is Marta.\nTONY\nHello, Marta.\nShe nods woodenly, stays across the room. Behind her, the\ntelevision set is on to the Cable Newswatch. The protagonists\nintermittently flick their eyes to it, soothing the tension.\nTOAD\nI'm Hector...\nPause.\nTONY\nYeah. I'm Tony. So Omar says you're okay.\nTOAD\nYeah, Omar's okay.\nTONY\nYou know Omar.\nTOAD\nOmar, yeah, I talk to him on the phone.\nTONY\nOkay...\nTOAD\nOkay... so you got the money?\nTONY\nYeah, you got the stuff?\nTOAD\nSure I got the stuff, but I don't\ngot it right here with me. I got it\nclose by.\nTONY\nYeah well I don't got it either, I\ngot it close by, too.\nTOAD\nWhere, in the parking lot?\nTONY\nNo. How far's your stuff?\nTony paces back towards, the door casually, to check Angel\nout... The Lizard staring at him...\nTOAD\nNot far.\nPause. Everything seems okay.\nTONY\nSo what do we do, walk in and start over?\nTOAD\n(changes subject)\nWhere you from?\nTony's eyes check out the bathroom.\nTONY\nWhat fuckin' difference does it make where I'm from?\nTOAD\nI like to get to know who I do business with.\nIt's like he's stalling for time. The Lizard has made a\nmove somewhere off-center and is now sitting on the bed,\ncoiled and always watching.\nTONY\nYou get to know me when you start doing business and not fucking around, Hector.\nTOAD\nHey I'm just a friendly guy, maybe you don't...\nTONY\nOkay, what's the stall here? Your guy late or something?\n36 INT. TOAD'S MOTEL ROOM - DAY\nThere's suddenly a door slamming somewhere outside, then\ncommotion.\nANGEL\nTony!\nTony goes for his cheap handgun when he hears a frightening\nfemale shriek, like a bird.\nLIZARD\n(slang Spanish)\nDon't! Get up! Now shithead!\nShe's standing there with a .32 pointed steady at him, the eyes like angry steel. There's no mistaking her ability to shoot.\nThe Toad pulls a 9mm out of the small of his back, approaches Tony. Angel is shoved into the room, followed by two more\nColumbians, \"The Kids\".\nThey slam the door, both carrying Uzis with silencers, neither of them higher than five-four or older than twenty, with their straight black Indian hair cut across their blank eyes, they look like hungry little piranha careless about killing, muttering with the Lizard in fast Columbese slang.\nAs Toad strips the handgun from Tony:\nTONY\nFrog face, you just fucked up. You steal from me, you're dead.\nToad shrugs, he couldn't care less.\nTOAD\nYeah, okay, you gonna give me the cash or am I gonna kill your brother first? 'Fore I kill you?\nTONY\nWhy don't you try sticking your head up your ass? See if it fits\nToad, completing the body search, rips out the stiletto\ntaped to the small of Tony's back. As he mutters something\nin hard Columbian slang to the two kids who shove Angel\ninto the bathroom, producing strands of thick rope.\nEven more worrisome is the chainsaw that the Lizard now\npulls out of the suitcase under the bed. Toad begins\nassembling it as Lizard, still covering Tony with her gun, completes the deadpan process by turning up the volume on the television set. The news, ironically not in Miami, is about a drug-related triple-homicide.\nCUT TO:\n37 EXT. SUN-RAY MOTEL - DAY\nChi-Chi sitting at the wheel of the sedan, parked across\nthe street. Manny paces outside the car, glances.\n38 EXT. SUN-RAY MOTEL - DAY\nA small woman -- the Lizard -- steps out in shadow in the\nparking lot of the Sun-Ray across the street, looks around,\nsees nothing, casually goes back in.\n39 EXT. SUN-RAY MOTEL - DAY\nManny looks at his watch.\nCUT TO\n40 INT. TOAD'S MOTEL ROOM - DAY\nAngel hangs suspended on the ropes from the top of the shower curtain bar, his legs straddling the edge of the bathtub. Toad slaps a tape over his mouth.\nTony, covered by the two kids, watches from the lip of the\nbathroom. He bucks angrily but the two kids ram their\npistols up against his temple and pin him to the door.\nAngel looks at Tony; the eyes between them steady. They're\ndead and they know it.\nToad, well-prepared, connects a voltage adapter and extension cord.\nTOAD\n(to Tony)\nYou watch what happens to your friend okay? If you don't want this to happen to you, you get the money.\nLizard reenters the room, shakes her head at the Toad who\nnods and turns on the whirring machine.\nThe Toad smiles amiably and angles the chainsaw slowly\ntowards Angel.\nThe two kids press tight against Tony, guns pointed at his\nbrains... Off-camera, we know what's happening as we hear the chainsaw and we watch Tony's shock and rage.\nLizard has no expression on her face. The machine cuts off.\nThe Toad steps back from the tub, blood splattered on his shirt, examining his first cut like a butcher. He glances at Tony.\nTOAD\nNow the leg, hunh?\nA brief glimpse of Angel slumped by one arm like a cow on a strap, streaming blood, eyes conscious and horrified; a terrifying sight. The chainsaw whirrs once more.\nCUT TO\n41 EXT. SUN-RAY MOTEL - DAY\nManny, definitely suspecting something now, moves with\nChi-Chi across the parking lot of the Sun-Ray Motel. They\nsignal and separate.\nCUT TO\n42 INT. TOAD'S MOTEL ROOM - DAY\nThe Toad turns off the chainsaw and steps back, now drenched with Angel's blood, totally unaffected. He looks at Tony.\nTony glances back at him with fury, tears involuntarily dotting his eyes.\nTOAD\nOkay, my 'caracortada', you can die too. Makes no difference to me.\nHe nods. The kids shove Tony forward and we glimpse Angel\nlying hunkered at his feet in the bathtub, in the steam of\nhis blood, piss dead.\nCUT TO\n43 EXT. SUN-RAY MOTEL - DAY\nManny moves crouched down the exterior corridor, Ingram\npistol in hand, past an older couple who pretend not to\nnotice.\nAt the door of Room 9, Manny waits, listens...\nCUT TO\n44 INT.

TOAD'S MOTEL ROOM - DAY\nand the door smashes open and Manny barrels through and\nshoots a surprised Lizard as she raises her pistol. She crashes backwards into the room, wounded. Everything happens very fast now.\nManny is at the lip of the bathroom, he fires and hits kid\none, who is turning, in the neck.\nTony, not tied up yet, spins on kid two and smashes the unloosened strap across his face, sending him reeling across the bathroom.\nThe Toad, chainsaw in hand, slashes at Manny.\nManny fires a burst into him and the Toad crashes backwards.\nManny now spins into a wall, hit in the side.\nThe Lizard, wounded on her knees, is firing her .32 at\nhim. In the background, the window simultaneously blows out as Chi-Chi appears firing a burst with his Ingram.\nIn sharp foreground, the Lizard crumples forward on her knees, foaming blood.\nTony, with the tape still stuck across his mouth, smashes kid two, pinned against the blood-stained sink, with the stock of his own Ingram.\nIn the midst of this, the Toad jumps up, wounded but with strength, he tears out the motel room door hysterical, gripping the whirring chainsaw in a reflex action.\nChi-Chi, climbing through the window, fires at him.\nMeanwhile, kid two, with a rattlesnake life in him, produces\na knife out of nowhere, just missing Tony's gut by a half-second as Tony dances back, getting a grip on the machine pistol.\nHe blows kid two away point-blank, putting another ten craters in the mirror of the now-wrecked motel room.\nTony, yelling, whirls after the Toad.\nTONY\nI got him!\nManny, holding his side, empties his pistol on kid one, who is still twitching.\nChi-Chi sees Angel, gags.\nCUT TO\n46 EXT. SUN-RAY MOTEL - DAY 46\nThe senior citizens, playing Mahjong on the porch, mutter\nin astonishment, as the Toad staggers out into the parking lot, blood flying, chainsaw in hand, moving like a jerky chicken.\nTheir eyes follow.\nAs Tony comes out, walking after him deliberately, eyes set in cold fury, machine gun swinging loosely at his side.\nThere's no rush, no fear of the police, getting even is all\nthat counts. He stands behind the Toad.\nTONY\n(Spanish)\nYour turn, cabron!\nThe Toad whips around to the voice, eyes stark with terror.\nTony empties the clip into the Toad, blowing him apart.\nThe bystanders just stare, stunned by the ferocity. Then\nan old lady faints.\nThe Toad's body lying awkwardly arched in the gutter, Tony\nturns and with a passing disinterested glimpse at his\naudience, calmly walks back into the motel; the distance\nand the light sufficient to conceal Tony's possible identification.\nCUT TO\n47 EXT. SUN-RAY MOTEL - DAY\nTony intersects Manny holding his side, with Chi-Chi.\nTONY\nManny, you okay?\nManny nods.\nTONY\nChi-Chi, get the car. Fast!\nCHI-CHI\nSi!\n48 INT. TOAD'S MOTEL ROOM\nTony strides into the shambles of Room 9, past the bodies\nand busted furniture to the suitcase on the bed from which\nthe Lizard pulled the chainsaw. The TV news still plays in the corner.\nInside are several kilo-sized stacks of cocaine.\nHe shuts the suitcase, exits, stops, looks in the bathroom at the corpse of Angel off-camera. He goes, stoops, brings Angel's Change charm into our view, fingers it, tosses it back in the tub. He goes.\nCUT TO\n49 EXT. SUN-RAY MOTEL - DAY\nChi-Chi has the sedan waiting in the parking lot. Tony\nhurries out, jumps in, the car speeding off. (Pisalo hasta la tabla -- Step on it.)\nPast the senior citizens who are retreating inside their\nrooms.\nThe camera swinging to hold on the blue and black Monte Carlo disappearing into the traffic of the Strip as two cop cars\ncome screaming past them from the opposite direction.\nCUT TO\n50 EXT.

LOPEZ CONDO - NIGHT 52\nA deluxe apartment with the latest in electronic security and surveillance, and a profusion of mirrors and luxury items... and a hefty, Indian-looking bodyguard (Ernie), eyes quietly trained like a Doberman pinscher.\nThe boss, Frank Lopez, comes down a carpeted corridor, dressed for dinner in an expensive suit and shoes, somewhat preoccupied as he greets Tony, then Manny, with a phony effusion of warmth. He's of Cuban-Jewish extraction, now Americanized in a rough and handsome sort of way, on the heavy side, the face going slightly soft, but the eyes and bulk carrying an odor of danger about him.\nLOPEZ\nHow ya doing, Tony? Glad to meet you. How 'bout a drink?\nTONY\nMr. Lopez... real pleasure.\nLOPEZ\nCall me Frank, Tony. Everybody calls me Frank. My Little League team, even the prosecutors 'round town, they all call me Frank.\nTONY\nOkay Frank.\nFrank shakes hands with Manny.\nLOPEZ\nHowya doing?\nMANNY\n(awed)\n...Fine yeah.\nTONY\nManny Ray, he was with us on the job.\nLOPEZ\n(to Manny)\nI hear you caught one?\nManny shrugs, works his arm, showing us the wound doesn't bother him too much.\nMANNY\nJust the flesh. Went right through.\nLOPEZ\n(heading for the bar)\nYeah, Omar here tells me good things about you boys.\nTONY\n(glances at Omar)\nYeah. Omar's terrific.\nLOPEZ\nNot to mention of course the nice job you guys did for me on that Commie sonufabitch Emilio Rebenga.\nTONY\nYou don't have to mention it. That was fun.\nLOPEZ\n(smiles, likes the kid's balls)\nScotch? Gin? Rum?\nTONY\nGin's fine.\nLOPEZ\n(pouring)\nYeah, I need a guy with steel in his balls. I need him close to me, a guy like you Tony -- and your compadre here.\nTONY\nYeah... well.\nStill a little overwhelmed by the opulence of the place, his clothes feeling narrow and cheap on him, Tony steps forward and puts the suitcase up on the bar with the gin, which Lopez passes to him, eyeing the suitcase.\nTONY\n...that's it. That's the two keys. Angel died 'cause of this shit. And here's the money.\n(produces the money)\nIt's my gift to you -- from me.\nPause. Lopez shakes his head, sighs.\nLOPEZ\nIt's too bad about your friend, Tony, if people'd do business the right way, there'd be no fuckups like this....\nHe glances hard at Omar who squirms.\nWithout opening it, Lopez signals the bodyguard who takes\nthe suitcase and the money from under Tony's nose.\nLOPEZ\nDon't think I don't appreciate this gesture, Tony. You find in this business, you stay loyal you move up and you move up fast. Salud!\nThey drink the toast. With their eyes.\nLOPEZ\nThen you find out your biggest head ache's not bringing in the stuff but figuring out what to do with all the goddamn cash.\n(drinks)\nTONY\nYeah, I hope I have that problem someday.\nLopez looks, distracted., down the corridor from which he came, to Ernie, the bodyguard.\nLOPEZ\nWhere the hell's Elvira? Go get her, will you, Ernie?\nThe big bodyguard exits smoothly.\nLOPEZ\n(to the others)\nThe broad spends half her life dressing, the other half undressing.\nTONY\nI guess you gotta catch her in the middle, hunh?\nLopez laughs.\nLOPEZ\nYeah. When she's not looking. What do you say guys, to a little food?\n(finishes his drink at his impatient pace)\nTONY\nYeah sure, I could eat a horse.\nERNIE\nHere she comes, Mr. Lopez.\nTONY looks up, his eyes tumbling on the most beautiful blonde he's ever seen. The lady, is coming down the glassed-in elevator, adjusting her $10,000 Yves St. Laurent burgundy dinner dress.\nLOPEZ\nOooh sweetheart, you look like a million bucks.\nShe doesn't answer, her eyes flicking disinterestedly over to Tony and Manny, knowing what the evening's going to be and not too happy about it.\n**ALTERNATIVE**\nLOPEZ\nWhere you been baby, it's ten o'clock, I'm hungry.\nELVIRA\nYou're always hungry, you should try starving.\nLopez laughs.\nLOPEZ\nI want you to meet a friend of mine.\nTony Montana...

If anyone wanted to assassinate\nyou, you wouldn't be too hard to find.\nLOPEZ\n(coming toward her, laughing)\nMe? Who'd want to kill me? I got nothing but friends.\nELVIRA\nYou never know, do you? Maybe the catcher on your Little League team.\nNeatly avoiding his intended smooch, she slips by him towards the door, her throat flashing a $20,000 strip of jewelry.\nELVIRA\nCome on, Frank, let's go.\nTracking a cool, polished hauteur, she exits the apartment.\nLopez, after a pause, snaps at his men.\nLOPEZ\nOkay, let's go.\nCUT TO\n54 EXT. THE BABYLON CLUB - NIGHT\nWe know this is no workingman's dive when Lopez piles them\nout of his Rolls, and the carhops are moving Bugattis, Lamborghinis and Corniches in a long snaking line down the driveway. Single girls in high-collared silver lame jumpsuits with cinched waists, prowl like big glistening tents back and forth across the entry doors, rich young coiffed playboys in their Porsches honking their horns in appreciation. Brain drain.\n55 INT. BABYLON CLUB - NIGHT\nThe interior is built like three or four plush apartments that run together on three separate levels with imaginative angles, mirrors, swimming pool, bars, twenty-piece band, hundreds of tropical plants, dance floor, video games, computers and a restaurant. It's a lavish fun spot that will play a central role in the film, a drug dealer haven and nighttime capital of South America.\nThe crowd, a combination of Caucasian and Latin, is mostly\nyoung, rich and happy and a lot of them coked; the girls, upperclass in sleek dresses, trim figures, heels, hats, sensuous bodies, yell as they dance to a black American music beat, \"Celebrating\" or \"Partying Down Tonight\".\nThe waitresses, mostly blondes, wear little coca channel\nhats pinned to their heads and the barest pants with hose\nand high heels.\nRich young guys with a lot of gold and diamonds on their\nnecks and hands huddle briefly in groups or chat.\nDown at the vid games are younger chicks in jeans and\ntough-looking tank tops with \"Motherfuckah\" and \"Fuck Me\"\nwritten on them. Manny's coming from the toilets, tries to pick one of them up.\nMANNY\nSo whaddaya say, hunh?\nHe flashes his tongue. She looks at him, amused.\nCHICK\nYou got a buck?\nMANNY\nSure I got a buck, whaddaya think I am, poor?\nCHICK\n(indicates the machine)\nPut it in, let's play.\nMANNY\nI had other things in mind.\nCHICK\nYou check out on this and we'll talk about other things.\nMANNY\n(looks off, concerned, then confronts the complex machine)\nFuck, how do you play this thing?\nCUT TO\n56 INT. BABYLON CLUB 56\nFrank Lopez, intoxicated, takes his heart pill with a slug\nof champagne. He sits next to Tony, who is agog at all this wealth. Omar and Ernie look on. Elvira is in conversation with a girl friend who has stopped by. They're sitting at the best table in the place, finishing up a giant meal. The empty spot belongs to Manny.\nLOPEZ\n(to Tony)\nOver there that's Ronnie Echeverria.\nHim and his brother Miguel, they got a big distribution set-up here to Houston and Tucson....\nTheir point of view -- Ronnie Echevarria, powerful, competent looking man in conversation with a party of people.\nLOPEZ\nThat guy there, in the purple shirt -- Gaspar Gomez. Bad news. Stone killer there ever was one. Stay away.\nTheir point of view -- Gaspar Gomez at a table with another\nguy and gorgeous woman.\nLOPEZ\n...the fat guy, with the chicas is Nacho Contreras -- El Gordo. Wouldn't know it to look at him but he's got more cash than anybody in here. A real haza....\nTheir point of view -- El Gordo is fat, dressed like a cheap slob and playing up to a bunch of chicas.\nLOPEZ\n. ..you know what a haza is, Tony?\nTONY\n'Haza'? No Frank, what's a haza?\nLOPEZ\nIt's Yiddish for pig. It's a guy he's got more'n what he needs, so he don't fly straight anymore, y'know. That's the problem in this business, Tony, there's too many 'hazas' and they're the ones you got to watch out for. If they can fuck you outta an extra dime, they'll rip you and flip you and then fuck you with a stick for the pure pleasure of it. See it all comes down to one thing, Tony boy, never forget it! Lesson number one -- don't underestimate the other guy's greed.\nELVIRA\nLesson number two -- don't get high on your own supply.\nThe girl friend has departed and Elvira turns her attention back to them, bored.\nLOPEZ\nThat's right. Course not everybody follows the rules.\n(eyeing Elvira)\nHEAD WAITER\nThere you go, Mr. Lopez.\nHe's popped the champagne cork and pours Dom Perignon for Lopez.\nLOPEZ\nGive it to everybody and bring another, willya Jack?\nHead Waiter nods.\nLOPEZ\n(to Tony)\nFive hundred fifty dollars for this bottle Tony, what do you think of that, hunh? For a bunch of fucking grapes -- isn't that something?\nELVIRA\n(to Tony)\nIn France, it cost $100 but don't tell anybody in Miami.\nTony catches her eye. She looks away, interested.\n57 INT. BABYLON CLUB - NIGHT\nA Man passes the table. Lopez calls out.\nLOPEZ\nHey, George -- buddy.\nMAN\nHey, Frank.. -how's the case coming?\nThe Man's eyes thread the table. He looks sharp, heavy-lidded, cigarette-eyed, his voice a hoarse croak, a cigarette dangling from his mouth, his manner cool but amicable with Lopez. This is George Sheffield, Miami lawyer.\nLOPEZ\nOy, I shoulda come to you 'stead of that putz, Neufeld.\nSHEFFIELD\nJack's a good lawyer. I taught him everything he knows.\nLOPEZ\nYeah, almost everything.\nSHEFFIELD\n(to Elvira)\nElvira, you look terrific...\n(to all)\nEnjoy yourselves.\nHe ambles off.\nLOPEZ\n. . . best goddamn lawyer in Miami.

I'd like you and your boys to handle some stuff for me, Tony, work with Omar here. We're doing something big next month. Running a string of mules out of Columbia. You do good on that, there'll be other things.\nOmar doesn't like it but glances away.\nTONY\nHey, that sounds like fun, Frank. Thanks.\nThe music shifts to slow dancing.\nELVIRA\n(waving away cigar smoke)\nSo, you want to dance, Frank or you want to sit here and have a heart attack?\nLOPEZ\nDance? I'd rather have a heart attack.\nELVIRA\n(rising)\nDon't foam into the Dom Perignon.\nGlancing at Omar, sitting there obediently. Her eyes say forget it.\nELVIRA\n(to Tony)\nHow about you?\nTony nods sure, looks at his boss.\nLOPEZ\n(waves)\nGo on!\nThey go.\n58 INT. BABYLON CLUB - NIGHT\nIt's interesting to watch Tony walk to the floor, leading Elvira. It's not so much an act of walking as it is an act of war, a tank bouncing anything or anybody off that gets in the way. Be just proceeds in a straight dead line, eyes forward. It's not that he doesn't see the people he bumps off, it's that he couldn't care less.\nLOPEZ\n(to Omar)\nWhat do you think?\nOMAR\nI think he's a fucking peasant.\nLOPEZ\nYeah -- but you get guys like that on your side, they break their backs for you.\nCUT TO\n59 INT. BABYLON CLUB DANCE FLOOR - NIGHT 59\nTony and Elvira are dancing semiclose to a slow Billy Joel\ndance tune.

I'm getting a headache.\nTONY\nJust trying to be friendly.\nELVIRA\nI've got enough friends -- and I don't need another one, 'specially one who just got off the banana boat.\nHe makes a point of looking at her.\nTONY\nHey, I didn't come over on no banana boat. I'm a political refugee here.\nELVIRA\nOh, part of the Cuban crime wave?\nTony, pissed, bangs once more into the elderly couple.\nThe man stops dancing, looks at him exasperated but Tony\ndoesn't see.\nTONY\nWhatta you talking crazy for, whatsa matter with you?\nELVIRA\n(interrupting)\nI'm sorry. I didn't know you were so sensitive about your diplomatic status.\nTONY\nWhy you got this beef against the world? You got a nice face, you got great legs, you got the fancy clothes and you got this look in your eyes like you haven't been fucked good in a year.

Cars honk angrily but he couldn't give a shit.\nTONY\nCome on!\nManny follows as Tony now moves across the opposite lane, a\ncar screeching to a halt in front of him.\nTONY\n(points)\nOkay Rober Retfor, strut your stuff.\nThe blonde has paused to look in a shop window.\nManny stops alongside, -pretends to look. When he catches\nher eyes, he flicks his tongue.\nShe looks at him, confused, then back into the window.\nManny looks back at Tony, winks, sidles closer to her.\nTony, exiting off to the side, catches the gaze of a somber\nchild, four, toddling along with it's mom. He makes his\nown version of a funny face at the kid who looks back at\nhim puzzled. Tony produces another face. The kid now\nsmiles. The mother looks over. Tony shrugs. She smiles and moves along.\nMeanwhile, Manny has moved close to the blonde and suggests something, his eyebrows raising, the smile crooked. It takes a moment, then the blonde socks him across the face and walks away.\nTony walks up to him, mocking.\nTONY\nI'm telling you man you got it- all mixed up.\nThis country first, you gotta get the money; then you get the power, and when you got the power, then you get the women -- then, chico, you got the world by the balls.

TONY'S MOTHER'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT\nThe interior is comprised of small, narrow rooms filled\nwith religious objects from macumba and waist-high black\nJesus statues in various corners. The floor is without rugs and mosaicked with inexpensive, Aztec-type tiles, the impression clean, cluttered, Catholic, somewhat depressing.\nStepping forward to the center of the living room like a cautious cat is his nineteen-year-old sister Gina. Their eyes lock.\nTONY\n(moved)\nHi Gina...\nGINA\nTony?\nShe looks at her mother confused. She's a naturally dark,\ncurly-headed beauty with a slim, graceful figure and\nlarge-lidded eyes brimming with the same energy as Tony's.\n(She might also be recognizable from the snapshot we saw in\nTony's possession.)\nTONY\n(covering his unwanted emotion)\nYeah, look at you, you're beautiful... what's it been seven years?

Always.\"\nGINA\nIt's beautiful Tony, it's just beautiful....\nThe mother is amazed at the cost of the gift. Tony pulls\nout another present, for her.\nTONY\n...for you too Mama, look....\nMoving towards her, he opens the package and pulls out an\nexquisite pearl necklace. She stares at it, doesn't take it. Gina comes over, takes it for her.\nGINA\nIt's beautiful... Mama,\n(offers it, an unspoken 'why don't you take it?')\nMama doesn't. Gina puts it away with her own.\nTONY\n(holding Gina by the shoulder, making light of it)\nWell anyway, here we are hunh? The three musketeers! We made it to America hunh?

You're not going to destroy her. I don't need your money, thanks. I work for my living -- and I don't want you in this house anymore and I don't want you around Gina. So leave us alone... go on, get out! And take this lousy\nmoney with you, it stinks!\nShe casts the bundle of bills back across the table at him\nlike dead lettuce.\nA silence. Tony sits there livid, soothing his scar, about to explode, but doesn't. Gina mutters something in the silence.\nGINA\nOh Mama... why do you got to spoil it for everybody.\n(to Tony)\nI'm sorry Tony, I....\nTony nods his head at his mother.\nTONY\n(gently)\nOkay, Mama, okay....\nCUT TO\n70 EXT.

Five years, ten years, it doesn't matter how long you been away, you're my blood. Always.\nPause. She stares intently at him, emphasizing it.\nTONY\nHey I know... I know.\nShe gives him a soft kiss. He takes out his money roll.\nTONY\nSay, I want you to keep this for yourself. Okay? Help Mama out, but don't tell her I gave you this, okay?\nShe hesitates... He nudges her on the cheek and slaps the whole wad into her palm.\nTONY\nGo on! Go out and have some fun, what the hell?

She peers in.\nGINA\nYou can come by the shop y'know, any afternoon, I'll be there okay?\nHer eyes fall on Manny at the wheel.\nHe smiles back with charm.\nGina's eyes pause on him, then withdraw.

GOLF COURSE - MIAMI - DAY 86\nFrank Lopez has Tony and Chi-Chi out on the golf course. Tony never played before and gets frustrated, swings his club at the ball like a baseball bat -- Lopez getting a kick out of him. Chi-Chi naturally makes a perfect putt, shrugging when Tony looks over at him amazed.\n87 INT.

COCAINE LAB - BOLIVIA - DAY 93\nSubtitle appears:\nCOCHABAMBA, BOLIVA\nAlejandro Sosa is a playboy, about six-foot-two, black wavy\nhair, athletic body and a Copacabana tan, the clothes, a\ncasual polo shirt and the latest pants from Calvin Klein.\nOn his wrist is a flashy gold ID bracelet with \"Alex' written in diamonds and on the other wrist a gold Rolex with a bezel full of diamonds worth maybe $30,000. His eyes fizzle with an energy derived not from drugs but the continual excitement of his toys and his money.\nAccompanying him everywhere is the Shadow, a thin, intense\nvenomous-looking Hispanic man in his thirties, he has the\nlook of death in an unsmiling face. He is always in\nproximity to his Jefe, usually slightly behind the person\nor persons addressing Sosa -- in a sort of garotte\nposition, his eyes swiveling to stare down the person who\nmight glance at him. He is a continual source of tension\nunderplaying the scenes, particularly coming to affect Omar\nwho is insecure to begin with.\nSosa is showing Tony and Omar through his coke processing\nlab, past four coal-fired stoves, each with massive iron\nkettles bubbling with coca paste... across to a row of ovens\nwhere the refined coke dries. The chemists and Indians\nworking there all acknowledge llel rey de1 rey\" as he passes, as proud of his factory as a vine grower his vineyard.\nSOSA\nSo this and my other factory can guarantee production of 200\nkilos refined every month of the year. Problem is, I have no steady\nmarket. Some months I can't get rid of fifty keys, other months I have to do 2 to 300 keys, it's crazy, hunh? Nobody can run a business that way ---\nOMAR\nI know what you mean Mr. Sosa, we got the same problems up in Miami, the demand varies for us too, month to month...\nSosa looks at him like that's obvious and moves on. In his\nskinny suit, with the wet cigarette clamped between his\nnervous fingers, Omar's not quite in his league with Sosa.\nTony, awed by the scope of it all, follows along, stops to\nlook at a sample of the dried coke.\nThe Shadow stops, eyeballs him.\nTony eyeballs him back, playing a game with him, then\nsamples the coke off his thumb into his nose.\nPause. His expression says I like it. He moves on.\nThe Shadow moves with him.\nSOSA\n(meanwhile)\n...Basically what I'm looking for is somebody to share the risks with me, somebody in the States who might guarantee me something like -- say 150 kilos a month.\nOMAR\nThat's a big commitment Mr. Sosa. It's too bad Frank's not here. Something like that you should talk to him.\nSOSA\nYes, it would've been nice if he could have come.\nTONY\n(cutting in)\nand he'd like meeting you too Mr. Sosa. But with his trial coming up y'know, it's not so easy for him to slip outta the country right now, y'understand?\nSOSA\n(taking the measure of Tony, sarcastic)\nSo he sent you?\nTONY\nYeah, something like that. You sure got good stuff in there Mr. Sosa -- class A shit.\nLooking over the laboratory like it was his.\nOmar glances at him, annoyed.\nSOSA\nWe'll talk at my house. Shall we go...\nCUT TO\n94 INT. SOSA VILLA - BOLIVIA - DAY 94\nThe camera moves past a spectacular view of the mountains\nto a cavernous dining room highlighted by huge paintings\nfrom the Spanish classical period and ornate candelabra.\nAt the table are Sosa, Omar, Tony. The Shadow sits impassively in a folding chair off to the side, watching Omar and Tony. Tony is impressed, looking at the plates, the glasses, the silverware, uncomfortable, trying to fit in.\nHe eats the salmon off a silver plate with oafish movements of his knife and fork as the servants move to and fro, constantly hanging dishes, confusing Tony (ad-lib during scene).\nSOSA\n(to Omar)\n...say Lopez guarantees me 150 keys a month for a year, and he picks it up down here, I could sell it to him for as little as 7000 a kilo. You cannot do better than that.\nOMAR\nWell, we do that, we gotta take the\nrisk of moving it. Also we'd be cutting out the Columbians. You\nknow what that means?\nTONY\nThat means we gotta go to war with\n`em.\nlooks over at him, not quite knowing yet what to make\nSosa\nof this guy.\nSOSA\nWhen we cut out the Colombians we take risks -- on both sides.\nTONY\nSplit the risk. Guarantee your delivery as far as Panama.\nSOSA\nPanama? Risky? It costs me more. There I'd sell maybe 13.5 a key.\nTONY\n13.5! What are you nuts? We still gotta take the shit to Florida. You\nknow what that's like these days?\nThey got the Navy all over the fuckin' place. They got frogmen, they got EC2s with satellite tracking shit in 'em, they got fuckin' Bell 209 assault choppers up the ass, we're losing one out of every nine loads. It's no duckwalk for us anymore, y'know. Forget it.\nOmar is looking at him, ready to explode at his blithe assumption of power -- whereas Sosa chuckles, amused by his brashness, starting to be intrigued by this animal.\nSOSA\nWhat do you suggest is a fair...?\nExcuse me.\nInterrupted, Sosa looks over at his black aide who suddenly\nappears at the door, apparently with a message. Sosa waves\nhim in.\nThe black aide -- The Skull -- is a slim, tall imposing man\nwith academic, 'horn-rimmed glasses and close-cropped hair\non a huge and impressive skull. He combines the physical qualities of an animal with an intellectual. As he approaches, he glances down the table, his eyes falling briefly on Omar who doesn't connect. The Skull falters -- just for a moment -- then continues towards Sosa with the same stony, loyal expression.\nSosa lends his ear and the Skull whispers his information.\nA beat.\nHe whispers a second thought. Sosa reacts minimally.\nThen he nods, dismissing the Skull who heads out the room.\nSosa glances at his gold Rolex.\nOMAR\n(meanwhile, in a whisper to Tony)\nShaddup willya Montana, I'm doing the talking here!\nTony shrugs.\nSOSA\nWhere were we?\nTONY\nPanama. You're looking for a partner, right?\nOmar shoots a poisonous glance at Tony.\nSOSA\n...something like that.\n(chuckles)\nOMAR\nLook Mr. Sosa, we're getting ahead of ourselves here. I'm down on Frank's authority to buy 200 keys, that's it, that's my limit. I got no right to negotiate for Frank Lopez on anything larger than that. So why don't we...\nTONY\nHey Omar, why don't you let the man finish, hunh? Let him propose his proposition.\nOMAR\nHey Montana, you got no authority here, okay! I started you in this business, all right, so shut the fuck UP!\nTONY\n(shrugs)\nFrank'll love it. Don't worry about it.\nOMAR\nThat's up to Frank -- not you.\nHe looks embarrassed at Sosa who has been watching, sensing\n-- also an advantage in the split.\nOMAR\nI'm sorry about this, Mr. Sosa...\nSOSA\nIt's all right. Maybe your partner's right. Maybe you should talk to\nFrank.\nOMAR\n(a beat)\nOkay. I don't think this is something I want to do on an overseas phone, but I can go back to Miami and talk to Frank personally.\nSOSA\n(without hesitation)\nGood. My chopper can take you to Santa Cruz now. I have a jet there that'll have you in Miami in five hours.\nYou can be back here tomorrow. For lunch.\nOmar is taken aback by the speed of the plan.\nOMAR\nYeah. I guess so....\nTONY\nGreat.\nSOSA\n(glancing at Tony, to Omar)\n...leave your friend here. While you're gone maybe he can tell me how to run my business.\nOMAR\n(doesn't get it)\nI don't think that...\nTONY\n(lighting a cigar)\nHey, it's okay. You tell Frank I'm keeping this guy on ice for him...\nSosa laughs. Omar scowls.\nCUT TO\n95 EXT. SOSA VILLA - DAY 95\nThe helicopter blades whirr. The Skull waits inside with the Shadow. They both stare at:\nOmar, who, with one hesitant look, steps inside.\nThe chopper lifts off the lawn, the camera moving to the\npolo players exercising in the distance... a woman on a\nhorse rides by and we swing with her towards the villa.\nSosa walks Tony down an outside gallery towards the veranda where servants lay out the coffee and fruits.\nTONY\nYou know why they say Cubans are all screwed up?\nSOSA\nWhy?\nTONY\nCause the island's in the Caribbean, the government's in Russia, the Army's in Angola, and the people live in Miami.\nSosa laughs. They reach the veranda, Tony glancing past Sosa to an exotic-looking, dark-eyed senorita who gets off her horse, held by a servant, and joins them.\nTONY\n(overlapping the joke)\nThey got a beard there that's all. With a cigar and a big mouth.\nSOSA\nMaybe he'll move to Miami too...\nGabriella, my rose -- how was the ride?\nSosa changes his personality completely with her, dewy-eyed and loving. They peck each other's cheek lightly.\nGABRIELLA\n(distracted)\nLovely... but the sheep in the north pasture, they're destroying the grass, it's turning yellow. You must move them darling.\nSOSA\nI'll take care of it myself.\nGABRIELLA\n(turning to him)\n...and don't forget we have the Rinaldi's at eight.\nSOSA\nOf course not. Uh -- an associate of mine. From Miami. Tony Montana...\n(to Tony)\nMy fiance, Gabriella Montini.\nTONY\nHello....\nShe nods to him in that somewhat uninterested, rude, upperclass Latin way.\nGABRIELLA\nIt's a pleasure.\nShe withdraws. Tony watches her go.\nTONY\nI gotta hand it to you. You got everything a man could want.\nSosa, pleased, reaches for an expensive set of binoculars on the patio table, looks up through them, at the helicopter rising off the lawn.\nSOSA\n(focusing the binoculars)\nI like you Tony. There's no lying in you... Unfortunately I don't feel\nthe same way about the rest of your organization.\nTony glances up at the chopper, the servant pouring coffee for him.\nTONY\nIn-- l -- Whaddaya getting at, Mr. Sosa?\nSOSA\nI mean Omar Suarez.\nTony, puzzled, glances up at the chopper which now hovers there high above the estate.\nSosa passes him the binoculars.\nSOSA\nThis garbage was recognized by my associate at lunch.\nFrom several years ago, in New York. He was an informer for the police....\nTony, astonished, looks up.\n96 THROUGH THE BINOCULARS - OMAR 96\nterrified, being positioned at the door of the chopper by\nthe Shadow and the Skull, his hands tied to his back and a\nlength of thick rope looped around his neck. He is struggling backwards in vain.\nSOSA\nHe put Vito Duval and the Ramos Brothers -- Nello and Gino -- away for life. My associate used to work up there.\nThrough the binoculars -- they throw Omar out of the\nchopper and he flies downwards and jerks back up as the rope stretches taut, snapping his neck. He hangs there like a broken doll on a string as the chopper moves out of sight.\nA silence.\n97 TONY 97\nshaken, lowers the binoculars.\nSosa watches him closely for his reaction.\nTony looks back at him, contemplative.\nSosa goes over, pours himself some coffee.\nSOSA\nSo how do I know you're not a 'chivato' too Tony?\nTONY\n(awry, stalks up to him)\nHey Sosa -- get this straight right now ! I never fucked anybody over in my life didn't have it comin' to him okay! All I got's my two balls-- and my word -- and I don't break 'em. For nobody.\nThat piece of shit up there I never liked, I never trusted..\nFor all I know he's the guy who set me up and got my buddy Angel Fernandez killed.\nBut that's history. I'm here. He's not. You wanna go on with me, say it. You don't, make your move, hodedor!\nSOSA\n(moves away)\nI think you speak from the heart Montana, but I say to myself this\nLopez -- your boss -- he has 'chivatos' like that working for him, his judgment stinks. So I think to myself, what other mistakes has this Lopez guy made, how can I trust his organization...hunh? You tell me Tony.\nTONY\nHey Frank's smart. Don't blame him for that animal. It's crazy business we're in, it can happen to anybody -- even you y'know. I'll talk to Frank myself. I'll fix this thing up right between you.\n(then)\nYou got my word on that.\nSosa approaches Tony, focusing an intense stare on him,\nmakes an elaborate gesture of putting his hands out, Tony\nfollowing the pantomime, puts his out. Sosa now grips them.\nSOSA\nYou speak with your eyes muchacho. I think -- you and I -- we can work this thing out, do business a long time together. Just remember -- it's the only thing I ever tell you -- don't fuck me Tony, don't ever try to fuck me.\nTheir eyes locked together.\nCUT TO\nAERIAL VIEW - MIAMI - TWILIGHT 98\nIn all its Caribbean splendor with the long curving beach\nand rich white buildings, bathed in a lovely violet light.\nMusic theme continuing over.\nREVERSE WIPE TO\n99 EXT. LOPEZ MOTORS AUTO DEALERSHIP - LITTLE HAVANA - DAY 99\nIn long shot we see an agitated Lopez entering his dealership with his bodyguard. Against a background of used American cars without great distinction, he ad-libs his way through some customers and salesmen, shaking hands and acting like everybody's favorite uncle... 'till we see him approach Tony, who is waiting for him with Manny\noutside his office.\nHe jerks his head. Inside. They go.\nCUT TO\n100 INT. AUTO LOPEZ OFFICE - DAY 100\nThe office is highly decorated with plagues, mementos,\nCuban patriot flags, and lots of photographs, centering on\nJFK and RFK shaking the hand of Lopez who now stares\nincredulously at Tony.\nLOPEZ\n(livid)\nYou what!

Seventy-five mill! That's serious money.\nLOPEZ\nYeah and what's Sosa gonna do to me when I don't come up with the first five million dollars on this deal --send me a bill? He's gonna send hit squads up here that's what. There's gonna be war in the streets.\nTONY\nFrank... Frank...\nLOPEZ\n(ranting)\nYou know what this fucking trial is costing me in legal fees, Montana?\n...You expect me to believe Omar was a stoolie.\nCause Sosa said so? And' you bought that line?\n(pause, eyeing Tony)\nMaybe I made a mistake sending you down there? Maybe you and Sosa know something I don't know?\nTONY\nYou saying I'm not being straight with you Frank?\nLopez's bodyguard shifts. Manny slips his hand closer to his belt.\nLOPEZ\n(carefully)\nLet's just say I want things to stay the way they are. For now. Stall\nyour deal with Sosa.\nLong pause. Tony's eyes meeting Lopez's. He gave Sosa his word.\nTONY\n(finally)\n...have it your way boss.\nHe turns to leave, nods to Manny.\nLOPEZ\nMontana... just remember I am the boss.\nTONY\nSure you're the boss.\nGets to the door, Manny joining him.\nLOPEZ\nY'know I told you when you started Tony, the guys who last in this business are guys who fly straight, real low key, real quiet.. -the guys who want it all, the chicks and the champagne and the flash -- they don't last.\nTony saying nothing, goes out the door with Manny.\n101 EXT.

Manny Ray.\nManny, standing in the background, nods... Sheffield shifts his eyes\nbriefly, back to Tony who plops himself in a chair.\nTONY\nSo George, they tell me you're the best lawyer in town.\nSHEFFIELD\nDid they also tell you how expensive I am?\nTONY\nHey it's like J.P.

We tell you who's moving against you, we shake down who you want shaken down, if you have a real problem in a collection, we'll step in for you. I got eight killers with badges working for me.

I found him stoned in the jungle and there's nothing you'll ever see like him. I present with great pride, from Caracas, Venezuela -- 'Octavia' !\nLights dimming to the bluesy rhythm of the Sinatra song as\nsad-eyed Octavia suddenly appears in the shifting spot-\nlight drawing immediate laughter.\nHe is dressed as an enormously fat old man with a Quasimodo\nmask covering both the front and back of his head and neck.\nWith a red bulb for a nose, he gyrates grotesquely to the sleek song; once the mood of laughter has been established, the music suddenly shifts upbeat to \"Saturday Night Fever\" and the clown, like a butterfly from a worm, starts shedding the stuffing from his clothes, his big eyes staring out at us in theatrical melancholy.\nTony watches, sitting alone, distracted by the clown.\nMore laughter, more clothes coming off, building a tempo.\nWhen the head mask comes off, we see the gaunt handsome\nface of a young clown in white paint with the large\nblackened eyes staring without expression at the laughing\naudience.\nTony is hooked by the image, looks on.\nThe clown is down to his leotards, thin as a stick, and\npulling the girls out onto the floor to dance with him,\nbouncing around like yo-yos. Everybody is laughing, everybody is merry...\n...except Tony and the clown, weaving in and out of the\nsharpening spotlight in his white face as the act comes to\nits close, a haunting figure of mockery....\nTony, absorbed by his thoughts, is lucky this time.

Bulletproof blackout shutters whap\nacross the shattered windows.\nHe guns the Jaguar out into the lot, bullets careening off\nthe armor plating, whining against the shutters.\nTony suddenly brakes the car and reaches down and slams the\ngear shift into reverse. In an instant, his warmobile in reverse, accelerates, climbing to top speed...\nAs hitter three realizes it's too late, tries to get out of\nthere, but is overtaken and crushed by the car.\nCUT TO\n115 INT.

How's married life? Say hello to the princess for me -- okay. She's beautiful.\nSee you. Take care.\nGoing.\nTony watches, raging inside. He pulls a drawer open and reaches for a private cocaine supply. It's the first indication we have of this. As he snorts:\nTONY\nThat prick, that WASP whore.

He drinks\ncoffee, smiles a lot and bullshits -- two sordid guys who\nlook the part.\nIt's a tedious process counting a million five in twenties, it takes four/five hours; and throughout the desultory dialogue Tony, absorbed by the money, and Nick never stop the monotonous work of counting and stacking and noting the amounts.\nAt all times all four men, thoroughly aware of the large stacks on the table, move and talk gingerly although they appear casual and bored. They drink a lot of coffee.\nLUIS\n. I . yeah back then I worked in pictures\nI was in that picture down in Columbia.\nBurn, y'ever see it? ...with Marlon Brando.\nWe're good friends.

HeyI George I go another four hundred grand -- I go 800,000 dollars, okay? With that you can fix the Supreme Court, hunh?\nSHEFFIELD\nTony... the law has to prove 'beyond a reasonable doubt.' I'm an expert at raising that doubt but when you got a million three undeclared dollars staring into a videotape camera, honeybaby, it's hard to convince a jury you found it in a taxi cab.\nTony paces back and forth like a tiger, corking his fury.\nAbruptly coming to a decision, he whirls and leans across\nSheffield's desk.\nTONY\nAll right -- all right. I do the three fuckin' years but lemme tell\nyou about my law, George. It's realsimple. There's no 'reasonable doubt.'

SOSA VILLA LIVING ROOM - DAY - VIDEOTAPE - 168\nMATOS STUDY\nA \"Phil Donahue-type\" setting. A segment now in progress\nwith the \"Donahue-type\" interviewing Dr. Orlando Gutierrez.\nGutierrez is a young charismatic man, very well dressed and\npolished in a South American manner who exudes a sense of\nenormous passion.\nGUTIERREZ\nMore than 10,000 of our people are being tortured and held without trial. In the past two years, another 6,000 have simply disappeared. And your government -- what does it do? It\nsells my government tanks, planes, guns, but not a word -- not-a whisper-- about human rights!\nINTERVIEWER\nI've heard whispers, Doctor Gutierrez, about the financial support your government receives from the drug industry in Bolivia.\nGUTIERREZ\nThe irony, of course, is that this money -- which is in the billions,\nJim - - is coming from your country. You are the major purchaser of our national product -- which of course is cocaine.\nINTERVIEWER\nSo what you're saying Doctor Gutierrez is the United States Government is spending millions of dollars to eliminate the flow of drugs into our streets and at the same time is doing business with the very same government that floods those' streets with cocaine... that's a bit like robbing Peter to pay Paul, isn't it?\nGUTIERREZ\n(laughs)\nLet me show you some of the other characters in the comedy, Jim... my organization just recently traced a purchase by this man --\nGutierrez holds up a photograph -- insert the face on the TV\nscreen, dour, ruthless.\nGUTIERREZ\n. . . here he is, the charming face belongs to General Cucombre, the Defense Minister of my country. Two months ago he bought a twelve million dollar villa on-Lake Lucerne in Switzerland.\nNow if he's supposed to be the Bolivian Defense Minister, what's he doing living in Switzerland? Guarding the cash register?\nLaughter.\n169 TONY 169\nwatching, touching his nose a lot, blowing it, hyped from\nthe coke usage.\nSOSA\nA Communist -- financed by Moscow.\n170 GUTIERREZ 170\nholds up another photograph -- insert the face on the\nTV screen.\nGUTIERREZ\n...this is Alejandro Sosa. Interesting character. A wealthy landowner. Educated in England. Good family. The business brain and drug overlord of an empire stretching across the Andes. Not your ordinary drug dealer....\nINTERVIEWER\nWhat are you suggesting we do about this, Doctor?\nGUTIERREZ\n(passionate)\nThe United States Government has to stop supporting these fascist gangsters that are running my country, that is what your country has to do. You have to set a strong example by calling for the observation of fundamental human rights.\n171 TONY 171\nstaring intently at him, reluctantly impressed.\nGUTIERREZ\nYou Americans have no idea how important your country is as a\nsymbol and a bastion of those rights. You have no....\nSosa flips off the television. The lights come on. He's alone with Tony.\nSOSA\n...he's scheduled next for 60 Minutes. He's going on French, British, Italian, Japanese television. People everywhere are starting to listen to him. He's embarrassing, Tony...\nThat's our problem.\nTONY\nYeah.\nSosa looks up.\nThe Shadow (seen before at the disposal of Omar) comes into\nthe room, thin and quiet, his venomous eyes flicking over\nTony. The Skull leads him in.\nSOSA\nYou've met Alberto before?...\nTONY\n(remains seated)\nSure. How could I forget?\nSOSA\nAlberto, you know Tony Montana -- my partner from Florida.\nAlberto nods icily, remains standing adjacent.\nSOSA\n(to Tony)\nSo you see Alberto here is going to help fix our problem. Alberto, you know, is an expert in the disposal business -- but he doesn't know his way around the States too well, he doesn't speak English, and he needs a little help...\n(*en)\nIs that a problem, Tony?\nTony looks around the faces, then:\nTONY\nThat's no problem, Alex....\nAlex nods, pleased.\nHold on Tony. He blows his nose again.\nCUT TO\n175 INT. THE RESTAURANT - MIAMI - NIGHT\nA millionaire's place, like \"The Forge\" on Arthur Godfrey\nRoad. Tony, Elvira, and Manny are shown to their table by the maitre d'. Tony, a little loaded, intersects a group of people at another table and stops, putting his hand on a heavyset man's shoulder.\nTONY\nHey, Vic, I watch your show everyday.\nVic -- who we saw before editorializing on television.--\ncranes his leonine white head of hair around with a\npatrician annoyance reserved for bores in restaurants.\nVIC\nOh, is that so?\nTONY\nYeah. Hey, you know that two hundred kilo DEA bust you was congratulating the cops for on the toob the other night?\nVIC\nAren't you... Tony Montana?\nTONY\n(beaming now, ignoring Manny who comes to retrieve him)\nYeah, that's me.\nThe half-dozen rich people in the dinner party are intrigued.\nTONY\n(waves to them)\nHi folks, don't get up. Anyway, Vic, check it out. I heard like it was 220 kilos went down. That means twenty is missing, right? Ask your friends, the cops, about that -- and keep up the good work, Vie, but don't believe everything you hear, y'know what I mean? Okay, have a good dinner, nice to meet you people.\nWaves farewell to them, pats Vic once more on the shoulder, and leaves them murmuring.\nMANNY\n(reproving)\nHey, Tony, that's not cool, he's got a lotta friends in....\nTONY\nI don't give a fuck. He's an ass-hole! Never fucking tells the truth on TV! That's the trouble in this country. Nobody fucking tells the truth!\nNot caring if he's overheard, Tony seems to be in the grip\nof an anguish he does not understand.\nCUT TO\n173 TONY\nsits with Manny and Elvira, who is dipping into a vial of coke in the purse in her lap. Another huge meal is being consumed, the best roast beef, bottles of red and white wine, cigars....\nMANNY\nSo what's the big mystery, what happened down there with Sosa?\nTONY\nLot of bullshit, that's what. Politics.\nThe whole world's turning into politics.\nHe pulls out his own vial under the table between eating and drinking.\nMANNY\nThe one thing we always stayed out of was politics, Tony.\nTONY\nYeah, so what do you think Emilio Rebenga was? Politics or what?\nManny remembers.\nTONY\nNo free rides in this world, kid.\nMANNY\nSo who's this guy you brought back with you, the guy who don't blink?\nELVIRA\nWhat guy?\nTONY\n(to Manny)\nYou stay out of it. Run things down here. I'll be up in New York next week.\nHe takes a hit, unnoticed.\nELVIRA\n(unheard)\nWhat guy?\nMANNY\n(to Tony)\nI don't like it.\nTONY\nYou don't like it! It was you got me into this mess in the first place with that fuckin' Seidelbaum!\nWhat's Seidelbaum got to do with this?\nTony sighs, turning his attention to Elvira. He surveys the\ntable with the bored satiety of a Roman Emperor, points to\nElvira's untouched plate.\nTONY\nWhy don't you eat your food, what's\nwrong with it?\nELVIRA\nI'm not hungry.\nShe quickly does one nostril with a quick, practiced move-\nment of her hand.\nTONY\nSo what'd you order it for?\nELVIRA\nI lost my appetite.\nShe does the other nostril. Tony looking at her. One beat.\nTwo beats. He passes a silent burp.\nMANNY\n(trying to shift the mood)\nSo what about the trial? I heard Sheffield thinks he can get a new postponement....\nTony, bleary-eyed now and drunk, continues to look at Elvira, then away, encompassing the restaurant.\nTONY\n(ignoring the question)\nIs this it? Is that what it's all about, Manny?\nEating, drinking, snorting, fucking? Then what?\nYou're fifty and you got a bag for a belly and tits with hair on 'em and your liver's got spots and you're looking like these rich fuckin' mummies in here?\nIs that what it's all about?\nMANNY\nIt's not so bad Tony, could be worse....\nTONY\n(doesn't hear)\n. . . is that what I worked 'for? With these hands? Is that what I killed for? For this?\n(turns his gaze stonily on Elvira)\nA junkie??? I gotta fucking junkie for a wife? Who never eats nothing, who wakes up with a quaalude, who sleeps all day with black shades on, who won't fuck me cause she's in a coma!\nMANNY\n(gently)\nTony, you're drunk.\nTONY\n...is this how it ends? And I thought I was a winner? Fuck it\nman, I can't even have a fucking kid with her, her womb's so polluted, I can't even have a fucking little baby!\nElvira reacts -- wanting to kill. She gets up and dumps\nher plate filled with food on him. Slop drips all over him.\nELVIRA\nYou sonufabitch! You fuck!\nThey got a black tie audience now. The waiter tipping\naround to clean up the mess. Tony slowly wiping the food\noff himself.\nELVIRA\nHow dare you talk to me like that!\nYou call yourself a man! What makes you so much better than me, what do you do? Deal drugs? Kill people?\nOh that's just wonderful Tony -- a real contribution to human history. You want a kid. What kind of father do you think you'd make, Tony? What kind of stories are you going to tell the kid before he goes to sleep at night? You going to drive him to school in the mornings, Tony? You really think you're still going to be alive by the time he goes to school, Tony? You're dreaming, Tony, you're dreaming!\nThe audience is hushed, involved, the camera moving over\nthe faces of Vie and his rich friends.\nTony acidly quiet, looks around at the people, back to her.\nTONY\nSit down before I kill you.\nELVIRA\n. . . You think of yourself as a husband, too, Tony. But did you ever stay home without having six of your goons\naround all the time? I have Nick the Pig as a friend? What kind of life is that Tony? What kind of life is that?\n(in a softer tone)\nOh Tony don't you see? Don't you see what we've become? We're losers, honey, we're not winners, we're losers...\nSilence. Tony's fury has passed. So has Elvira's. There's\nthis awkwardness all of a sudden like two actors who forgot\ntheir lines.\nTONY\n(softly)\nGo on, get a cab home, you're stoned.\n(to Manny)\nManny.\nELVIRA\nNo, I'm not stoned Tony. You're stoned. You're so stoned you don't\neven know it.\nTONY\nAll right I'm stoned.\nMANNY\n(rising, trying to put his arm on Elvira)\nCome on, baby.\nELVIRA\nNo, no you stay right there Manny, I'm not going home with you... I'm not going home with anybody. I'm going home alone...\n(staring at Tony)\nI'm leaving you. I don't need this shit anymore.\nPause. She starts wobbling out.\nPast the silent spectators, their eyes moving between her and Tony. Manny rises to follow.\nTONY\nLet her go! ...Another Quaalude and she'll love me again.\nStumbling once, Elvira disappears out the door.\nTony's eyes follow her. Pause.\nThe whole room is watching him sitting there covered with\nfood, the silence cathedral. He stands, wiping at the food\nand throwing several hundred dollar bills on the table,\nthen looks up angrily at the staring millionaires.\nTONY\nYou're all assholes. You know why?\nCause none of you got the guts to be what you want to be.\nHe wobbles against the table. Manny tries to help. Tony\nshakes him loose.\nTONY\nYou need people like me so you can point your fingers and say 'hey there's the bad guy!' So what does that make you? Good guys? Don't kid yourselves. You're no better'n me. You just know how to hide -- and how to lie. Me, I don't have that problem. I always tell the truth -- even when I lie.\nHe starts out, staggers.\nTONY\nSo say good night to the bad guy...\nYou're never gonna see a bad guy like me again.\nHe walks out, proud, Manny bringing up the rear. The room\nis empty for a beat -- an extended beat, the stage without\nits star -- and then the audience begins to buzz with horror\nand delight.\nCUT TO\n174 EXT.

With subtly inexorable music, the\ncamera frames and moves on the bomb -- wired, soldered,\ntaped -- a malignant centipede in the long agile fingers of\nthe Shadow, who delicately presses a tester. A glass button on the bomb now flashes red at soothing intervals as the Shadow winds a roll of black tape from the bomb to an\naxle of the car.\n177 ERNIE\nsignals.\n178 TONY\nsees it.\nA cop car comes cruising off the avenue up the street,\ntowards us.\nGround level -- the Shadow continues to wind his black tape trying to secure the bomb as tight as possible.\nTony hurries to the car, bends down.\nTONY\n(Spanish)\nPsst!

Inside a wistful Billy Joel song plays over the stereo. He rings a buzzer, waits.\nHold the pause. The door opens casually. Standing there is Manny -- with a towel around his waist.\nMANNY\n(surprised)\nTony?\nTony stares, stunned.\nGina now comes into view behind Manny -- in a bathrobe, a\nbig smile of welcome for her brother.\nGINA\nTony!\n(eyes suddenly moving downward in alarm)\nTony with his Beretta pointed at Manny, his expression filled with loathing.\nManny smiles easily and shrugs, the gesture drawing Tony over the edge.\nMANNY\nHey Tony, c'mon we was....\nThe gun fires.\nGINA\nTony!

We gotta get out of here\n(to Gina)\nCome on baby...Gina!\nSuddenly she goes berserk.\nGINA\nNoooooooooooo!\nAnd shoving Chi-Chi aside, launches herself on Tony, screaming incoherently like a madwoman, trying to kill him. She beats him around the head, the chest, scratches furrows of flesh from his face. He stands there, oblivious, numbed.\nChi-Chi and Ernie have a demon on their hands. They manage at last to yank her off Tony, kicking and continuing to scream.\n220 EXT.

Put her upstairs.\nPut her in my bedroom.\n(to Gina)\nIt'll be all right, pussycat, you'll see everything'11 be okay, I'll take\ncare of you....\nShe looks up at him through her stupor and spits in his face. Chi-Chi and Ernie pull her away -- as Tony stares, upset but passive.\nThey trundle her up the stairs. Tony turns and walks away.\n224 INT. TONY'S OFFICE - NIGHT 224\nTony slumps on his couch. A haze of coke rises off the velvet like a snow scene painting on a Christmas card.\nOblivious to the dust, he cuts open a fresh plastic kilo bag of coke and spreads the entire pound out across the black marble coffee table.\nErnie and Chi-Chi come in.\nCHI-CHI\nWe got some pills into her, she's cooling down.\nTony pays no attention, Ernie and Chi-Chi noticing the pile of coke.\nFlashing his silver tooter, Tony snorts a truly giant amount in a large pendular swing of his elbow across the length of coffee table.\nPause as he lets it sink in.\nCHI-CHI\n(worried)\nBoss, what we gonna do now?\nTONY\nDo?

TONY'S MANSION GROUNDS - LATER THAT NIGHT 225\nThe Bengal tiger paces his spot, restless.\nA monsoon-like wind blows through the trees on the estate.\nThe monkeys listen quietly.\nThe flamingoes flutter.\n. . . Then there's a burst of loud music from the stereo speakers on the balcony -- a Billy Joel song, something smooth and easy about the high times and how fast they go...\n. . . and we see Tony, in long shot, throw open the terrace doors and stagger out onto the balcony, overlooking his estate.\n. . . On a closer angle, we track him to the edge of the\nbalustrade. He's done so much coke now he's practically\ncatatonic; staggering and muttering to himself.\nTONY\n(insensate)\n. . . Jesus fuckin' Christ whatsa matter with me, get a hold of y'self now these cocksuckers gonna run over you, let 'em try, I bury the cocksuckers....\nHis point of view -- panning his estate. The dark emptiness echoes back at him. The wind rustling the treetops.\nTony shaking his head at himself, he starts to cry!\nTONY\n...Ooooh fuck Manny, how the fuck did I do that? How the fuck! ...oh Manny, Manny ...you were there for me, you were the one, Manny, you understood, always understood...\nWell what the hell happened, hunh?\nWhat the hell happened to us?...\nIn far background. now, behind Tony, on the video monitors in his office we see:\nThe main gate and guard shack -- a Marielito crosses into view, checks the gate, turns. Suddenly two figures spring\nout at him. One of them garrotting the Marielito. He struggles.\nAnother monitor now reveals two more figures moving into\nthe interior of the guard shack. They knife the other Marielito.\nA third monitor carries another image of shadows moving\nthrough the trees on the estate.\nOn the balcony, Tony is oblivious to it all, spent, almost\nincoherent.\nTONY\n...I said to you, Manny, I said I never go crazy and you said, I would\nyou sonofabitch and you was right... those were the good days hunh, we was crazy back in those days, we'd do anything, you and me, we was on the way up, nobody nothing coulda stopped us cause we were the best hunh -- the fucking best...\nAs Tony turns and starts back through the terrace doors into his study, the camera glides around to a view of a hook flying up and catching the balustrade. A shadow starts climbing up as:\nTONY\n...we still are Manny, we still are-- see, I'm gonna wipe out all them fuckers out there, I'm gonna run the market, I'm gonna be King Cocaine you hear me, you buy, you buy from me -- Tony Montana. Covers of all the magazines. Fan mail. Television stars, movie stars, shooting stars -- he's a star....\n226 INT. TONY'S MANSION - OFFICE 226\nAs he crosses into his office, the camera moves to reveal Gina standing there half-dressed in the doorway, her eyes blazing with hatred.\nTony sees her.\nShe steps forward, offering her body almost naked to her\nbrother.\nGINA\nIs this what you want Tony?...\nTony shocked.\nGINA\nYou can't stand another man touching me. So you want me Tony, is that it? Well here I am.\nShe fires the Baretta we now see in her hand.\nThe bullet grazes Tony in the leg, snapping him from his catatonia as he goes reeling across the floor behind his desk. She fires again. Again.\nGINA\nI'm all yours Tony, I'm all yours now.\nBullets ripping into the desk. She advances, offering her sex, methodically shooting out the clip at rhythmic intervals.\nGINA\nCome and get me Tony. Before it's too late.\nHe spins across the run away from the desk, trying to put\ndistance between them. She sees him scurrying,. turns, an\nexpression like a demented angel.\nGINA\nCome on Tony, fuck me! Fuck me! Fuck me!\nAdvancing on him, firing. The furniture tearing up, the chair\nspilling, television sets and computer toys shattering, Tony\nsquirming away, hit again in the thigh, shocked, scrambling\nover to the terrace windows. Her next shot shatters the window and as Tony ducks again to the side, we see outside onto the terrace behind him:\nA young Columbian punk no more than twenty -- one of the\nhitters -- is crouched there, reacting to the broken window.\nHe doesn't hesitate, turning his machine gun on Gina.\nGina is torn to pieces by the firepower -- blown across the\nroom, spine severed and dead before she hits the floor.\nTony sees it, yells something, in the same instant swivels to knock the barrel of the machine gun aside.\nThe punk is taken by surprise, not having seen Tony, and Tony now runs him backwards across the balcony and hurls him over the balustrade.\nThe punk lands in one of the shallow pools on the grounds\nat the base of the balcony.\nTony, from above, grabs up the punk's machine gun and\nempties the whole clip into the figure thrashing in the pool below.\nErnie runs into view on the far side of the pool, spots Tony, yells up ---\nERNIE\nGet outta here!\nTony, they're everywhere!\nErnie suddenly wheels, hit in the face, by a burst of silencer bullets.\nWe catch a brief glimpse of Sosa's black aide, the Skull,\nmoving quickly along the wall of the house -- directly\nunderneath the balcony on which Tony stands.\nTony, tossing the empty machine gun aside, wildly runs back\ninto his office to get more guns, crosses to Gina corpse.\nIt takes him by surprise. He comes to a dead stop, kneels, looking questioningly in her face.\nTONY\n(gently)\nHey Gina come on, you still angry at me? I didn't mean to kill Manny, I was... I was.\nRunning his hands along her face, trying to rouse her, gently lifting her eyelids. Blood's running out of her mouth in rivers.\nTONY tx:\nCome on Gina, get off the floor.\nYou're all dirty now, you need a bath...\nMami's gonna be angry baby\n-- ooh is she gonna be mad at me!..\nCome on open your eyes my baby,\nopen your eyes.. -give me a smile.\nThere's been a steady pounding and calling now on the door of the office. Tony finally hears it, looks up, then over at the monitors.\nOne of them reveals Chi-Chi standing there outside the door\npounding it.\nCHI-CHI\nBoss ! Hey boss. Open up!\nOn the monitor we see Chi-Chi suddenly spin and open fire\ndown into the foyer. Return fire decimates him. A grenade\ngoes off, blows him up against the door.\nTONY\nCheeee!\nHe now seems to come out of his catatonia, runs to his\nsideboard, hauls out a rocket shoulder-fired rocket launcher and straps an Uzi across his shoulder. He looks up at the monitor.\nOn the monitors, the hitters are now darting across the\nfoyer and coming up the left and right hand stairs.\nThree of them are already huddled outside the door, around\nthe corpse of Chi-Chi, motioning to-each other, laying a grenade at the base of the door to blow it out.\nTony loading his rocket, intends to beat them to the punch,\ntalking to himself.\nTONY\nSo you wanna play hunh, say hello to my little friend here.\nKarroooomph!\nThe rocket tears down the door and blows the Columbian punks off the landing into the foyer.\nIt sounds like Armageddon, one of the hitters screaming, smoke billowing wildly.\nTony, at the height of his mad glory, steps out at the apex\nof the stairs, firing his machine gun and yelling.\nTONY\nWhores! Cowards! You think you can kill me with lousy bullets hunh?\nAnother hitter tumbles down the right-hand stair.\nTONY\nWho you think I am? I kill all you fuckin' assholes. I take you all to fuckin' hell!\nAnother hitter drops, screaming, off the stairs into the pool below.\nA grenade goes off. Tony is hit again, but keeps on firing\naway. Laughing like a madman.\nTONY\nYou need an army you hear! An army to kill me!\nBehind him we see the remainder of the pound of cocaine go\nup in a burst of wind, whipping around the office in auras of white.

true king of the genre.\n\nThrough an extended metaphor, the song relates the microphone (a… \nRead More\n \nIt all starts back in Italy, actually in Sicily\nA sad symphony in the early Twentieth Century\nA dark peasant boy named Benito Raphioni\nIn the barn with the ponies and leftover macaroni\nBut the lack of bread left him hungry when he's back in bed\nSo he racked his head dreamin' of what he could have instead\nWalkin' around his village, never askin' for sympathy\nAnd the lack of affinity had him practice divinity\n'Till he had an epiphany and he gathered his misery\nPacked it in a tiny bag and then he scattered from Italy\nWoulda traveled it differently, had he had the ability\nBut without a penny, Benny couldn't travel efficiently\nGatherin' his scraps, bought a third class to Manhattan\nPacked with the packages of the passengers in the cabin\nGreeted by the Lady of political Liberty\nCity imagery of vividly livin' in Little Italy\nEntered Ellis Island with only a small sac\nHis skin so dark, they thought he was all black\nTook the I's out of his name, Benito couldn't complain\nRaphioni or Raphone, to him it was all the same\nHe just wanted money so he started workin' at the docks\nBut could only make enough for a little place in the Bronx\nA diligent immigrant in a primitive tenement\nWith the skill of a city citizen bringin' in dividends\nNow he's livin' with benefits and it opened his mind\nSo he's hopin' to find his utopian bride\nBenito opened his eyes to a beautiful black queen\nNo longer was she broke and deprived\nOn the way to top class, 'till the morning she woke with a hot flash\nCash from the dock stash stopped fast when the stock crashed\nBenito contemplatin' robbery and slaughter\nThat's what happens when you mixin' the milk with the tap water\nPerverted by the Dirty Thirties\nHe heard of murder but assertively averted juries\n'Cause he would rather have a family at home, didn't plan to be alone\nSo they had a little boy named Anthony Raphone\nAnd Anthony had grown dark like his poppa is\nHangin' on the street corners of Metropolis\nHe was proud of his heritage but his dad's music had to go\nMad dudes would rock the show – jazz, blues and rock & roll\nSo he would hit the nightclubs and reside inside\nComin' eye to eye with this pretty little Irish bride\nMovin' in together unexpectedly\nHad a little baby girl in the early seventies\nLast name Raphone, first name Michelle\nIt ain't hard to tell, yo \nher name should ring a bell\nI said last name Raphone, first name Michelle\n\"It ain't hard to tell\"\n\nIn a black neighborhood back then when they hate the Irish\nMichelle was called a \nmic\n but was never afraid to hide it\nWhere you come from, there's nothing they can do to disparage it\nYo especially when you carry a beautiful heritage\nThis is strictly allegorical, the race is no concern to me\nThe story's metaphorical, emphasis on diversity\nEmphasis on the poverty, and makin' it through\nAll of the places that dedication is takin' you to\nAnd so, as Michelle grew, it would only take some time\nA proper way to find the \n\"N.Y. state of mind\"\nShe was hangin' with the hip-hop heads and all of the thugs\nMichelle flows with shell toes inside of a club\nStayed connected to the turntables\nEven though she was a tomboy, she was always the life of the night\nBut her friends never thought her name was an accurate label\nAnd so everybody started callin' her Mikey or \nMike\nBut despite the masculinity, her virtuous virginity\nWould eventually mingle its way into her identity\nAnd by the time that Mikey was nineteen\nShe had become a woman – no – matter fact a queen\nPsychedelic rays, an amazin' way with men\nWith intelligence, benevolence, and beauty in the perfect blend\nIf you were stressed or you ever felt depressed\nYou would go and talk to Mikey and she would help you express (yes)\nGradually became a symbol in the rap community\nEvery single rapper wanted her, even including me\nAnd she was older, but still I wanted to hold her\nAnd hopefully be the soldier that's standin' over her shoulder\nBut hope isn't always noble enough when movin' a boulder\nIf you was in my position then tell me what you'd have told her\nIn order to win her over, all I wanted was a taste\nFace to face, ready to embrace\n\nAnd I would always see her in my dreams, she was slippin' in my bed\nDiminishin' inhibition the minute she's in my head\nWith Nag Champa burnin,' we're kickin' it like karate\nMy hand would be at peace when it was wrapped around her body\nPerfectly curved, her skin shiny and black\nWith a tattoo on her back that said RadioShack\nI would play an instrumental and read her my poetry\nAnd if she liked what I was sayin' then she would come close to me\nRight in front of my lips, now we're ready to kiss\nThe room was fillin' up with a mist\nSuddenly the connection was made, and I was drained of my energy\nSo I burst and I gave her everything inside of me\nWe even had a child in one of my other dreams\nA beautiful baby girl that I named Harmony\nHarmony Dussolliet, and if you translate the name\nHarmony of the Sun is the creation that I made\nBut eventually I'd awake, and no longer could I reach her\nA pain that was burnin' my body like it was \n\"ether\"\nAnd everywhere she went, Mike was always adored\nYo they even have her picture on the cover of The Source\nAnd her name is comin' up in songs like all the time\nBut out of this long list, only one comes to mind\nIt was this one song where the chorus was like…\n\"All I need is one mic\"\nBut like I said in the beginnin' yo this song that I been singin'\nIs a tragedy, so naturally it has a tragic endin'\nAnd I was so concerned with it when I learned that it happened\nSo it's

mothafuckin' date, we takin' all the hoes\nShop 'til I drop, freshest corpse in the morgue\nLookin' like a fashion fossil, I'm Gianni reborn\nFour, I was voted most likely to trap\nIt's survival of the trillest, nigga, die or adapt\nWaste a lot of champagne but I don't waste a drop of time\nPublic with my gang relations, throwin' up the proper signs\nSawed off the shotty, got the chopper circumcised\nChevy so clean, look like I dipped that bitch in turpentine\nAll my homies certified, hottest nigga outchea\nLooked like Joan, we burned alive\nThought that I would ball 'til I fall, then I learned to fly\nSpread my wings\nThey say success is contagious so I share my dreams\n[Verse 28: Nasty Nigel]\nBolo swingin' from left to right\nI'm not a cholo but I know hoes out in SoHo lovin' my ethnic type\nWhen I smile for the photo looking like Lobo\nMe and my bloodshot eyes, I pass on the Bud Light Lime\nJust pass me that brew of St. Ides\nGot cash, I ain't gotta think twice\nUnconventional shit, pretentious hipsters that diss\nHalf-assed review on Fader, still get no love from Pitchfork\nNigel Rubirosa, que la cosa?

Yeah, you know us\n11-36-8 be the zip code\nCorona, Queens, nigga, that's what I call home\nFeet on the dash, mind on the ass\nRacin' the Sun just so I can get dome\nPimped the shorties I've been with\nMy friends that had me evicted\nIt's been two years and I'm slippin'\nStill got no pot to piss in\nAs far as everyone goes, they can suck and kneel on it\nWe have another song, gotta fuckin' feel it\nGot my eyes on the Harley and I'm trying to peel it\nHad my eyes on the bitch but she married Keaton\nGot no job so I'm hardly eatin'\nAnd you eatin' then we fuckin' beefin'\nI need a pie and pizza just to meet up for a fuckin' feature\n[Verse 29: Bobby Creekwater]\nMan, they don't wanna see a nigga\nWinning in a mothafucka, happier than a mothafucka\nYou know lightweight grinnin' in a mothafucka\nWhen you're a dead guy and you on that high\nSo the whole world spinnin' in a mothafucka\nAnd a couple young angels hide their halo\n'Cause they're 'bout to start sinnin' in a mothafucka\nThey don't wanna see a nigga on the upswing\nIn a black tux with cufflinks\nWhen you're the reason that every single girl in the party\nWanna dance and cuff drinks\nWhen you're the reason that shit gets ran\nAnd mothafuckas wheezin' to keep up with the plan\nAnd the other niggas show up at your function\nActin' all anti-social, no, a nigga fan\nRun up on your mama puttin' money in her hand\nAnd you do that shit again and again and again\nPull up in the 8, goin' home with a 10\nAnd you really can't defend or depend on your friends\nEx girlfriend wanna key up the Benz\nWhen the Sun

harlot\nCream FILAs and Carhartt, three-wheelin out the car lot\nPut the snorkel on the Wrangler 'cause I'm silly\nI chip a little piece of brick into the Philly\nMy daughter's neck is chilly, my son's neck is chilly\nMy mother wrist so cut look like it got bit by a grizzly\nAnd these drugs got me spinning like some Capoeira\nStill rock the slow beats with gold teeth, ain't afraid to hold

  "will easley|back in the mood": "3 Contributors\nA Brief History of Kamikaze Lunar Missions Lyrics\nMotherboard breaks down the long history of crashing things into the Moon…for science!\n\nCheck out the original story on Motherboard!\nOn Friday evening, the LADEE (Lunar Atmosphere and Dust Environment Explorer) was blasted into space atop a Minotaur V rocket, from NASA's Wallops Flight Facility in Virginia\n. \nThe spacecraft will circle the Earth a few times\n before heading off to study moon dust and atmospheric conditions sometime in early October. It will be hard at work for about six months, and like so many spacecraft, it will not be welcomed home after its work is finished. Once the LADEE has clocked out, it will honorably crash land on the moon. May it rest in pieces.\nThe idea of deliberately crashing unmanned ships on the moon goes back almost a century, to Robert Goddard's 1919 monograph A Method of Reaching Extreme Altitudes\n. The bulk of Goddard's treatise covered his experimentation with proto-rockets, but he concluded with an astonishingly vivid description of the possibilities unleashed by his research. He wanted to launch a ship engineered to release a large quantity of flash powder on the lunar surface, which would be ignited after impact.\nThe result would be a blast of fiery sparkles, easily observable from Earth. \nAt the time, he was accused of being a mad scientist by multiple newspapers, which factored in to his notorious paranoia later in life\n. But the idea metastasized in the scientific community and came to fruition during the Space Race. Goddard's redemption was posthumous, but it was glorious nonetheless.\nThe Soviets were the first to capitalize on the idea, which is not surprising since they had an embarrassingly huge lead in the early years of the Space Race. On September 4th 1959, they launched Luna-2, which would become the first spacecraft ever to reach the lunar surface. It gloriously crashed near the Mare Imbrium, the same region that was bombed by an errant meteorite in March of this year. It was also one of the weirdest-looking spacecraft ever to grace the skies, and that's a seriously competitive category.\nThe LADEE\nNASA was only a year old when Luna-2 face-planted on the moon, and they rushed to catch up by initiating the Ranger program\n. The aim was to take close-up photographs of the lunar surface, and then get up close with the surface themselves. But the missions were initially a disaster—a crash program in more than one meaning of the phrase. The program was so disorganized that it earned the humiliating nickname “shoot and hope.”\nRangers 1 through 6 failed, \nthough Ranger 4 did end up colliding with the dark side of the moon, accidently becoming the first American spacecraft to reach another celestial body (yay?)\n. Ranger 6 also ended up on the moon, but it didn't return any photos. Finally, in 1964, NASA had worked out the kinks enough to launch \nRanger 7,\n which successfully took photos and crashed exactly where it was supposed to. The next two missions in the program also succeeded, so having saved some face, NASA capped the Rangers off at 9.\nIt would be two decades before purposely bashing the moon in the face with spaceships became fashionable again. Japan, of all nations, kick-started the revival. The Hiten spacecraft, known as the “Celestial Maiden” in English, was launched in 1993 to study Lagrange points and lunar dust. Befitting of its English moniker, it was sacrificed to the moon gods, becoming the first spacecraft launched by a country other than the USA or Russia to reach the lunar surface.\nNASA got back in the moon-crash game big time\n with the Lunar Prospector, which was launched in 1998 as part of the Discovery Program. It was a complex mission that included analysis of the moon's gravitational and magnetic properties, as well as confirmation of the existence of ice at the poles. The Prospector completely aced its exams, and peaced out on the moon's south pole in early 1999. Since then, practically every nation with any space-faring ambition has pulled off a deliberate crash landing. SMART-1, the European Space Agency's baby, bit the moon dust in 2006; \nIndia's appropriately named Moon Impact Probe (alternately: Chandrayaan-1) crashed in 2008\n; China's Chang'e 1 went kaput in 2009.\nStill, in the 21st Century, the most dramatic lunar impact missions definitely belong to the USA, which makes sense given how culturally inherent blowing stuff up is to the nation. Preceding LADEE was the epic \nLCROSS mission of 2009, which was not unlike Goddard's original vision of lunar firebomb\n.\nThe spacecraft's main directive was to tear a chunk of the moon out so that scientists could study the plume, and oh, how it delivered—250 metric tons of material were ejected from the surface after the explosion. You might also remember last year's Grail mission, sent to study the moon's gravitational field and internal structure with twin probes. After a successful nine months of orbiting their subject, \nGrail A and Grail B pulled a “Thelma and Louise” on December 17, 2012.\nSo while the LADEE's ultimate fate may seem harsh, especially if you can't help but anthropomorphize satellites, it is far from unprecedented. The moon is already a gigantic graveyard for kamikaze spaceship missions. At least the LADEE, the latest addition to the junk heap, will have plenty of company up there.",

  "molly parden|i envy the wind": "2 Contributors\nTurn 01: The Day a New Demon Was Born Lyrics\nAll summaries are from tv.com.\n\nEpisode Summary\n\nIn the year 2010, Japan was invaded and taken over by the empire of Britannia. Japan, now called Area 11, and it’s people, the Elevens; live under a… \nRead More\n \nThe date was August 10 in the year 2010 of the Imperial Calendar.\n \nThe Holy Britannian Empire\n had just declared war upon Japan.\nThe Far East island nation had held fast to its neutrality, and now Britannia looms as the world's only superpower.\nRights to Japan's underground resources became a hotly disputed issue straining the already deep-rooted diplomatic tensions between the two sides.\nIn the deciding battle for the mainland, Britannian forces introduced into combat \nthe humanoid autonomous armored knight known as the Knightmare Frame.\n The enemy's forces were far greater than anticipated, and the Knightmares obliterated the Japanese line of defense on the mainland with little effort.\nJapan became a dominion of the Empire. The country was stripped of its freedom, its rights, and its name.\nArea 11. The defeated and once proud nation of Japan was rechristened with a mere number.\nLelouch: \nI swear... I swear, Suzaku, so help me. I will one day obliterate Britannia!\n[Theme song & title sequence]\nBritannian Police 1: This is Alpha-3! Target is traveling from Delta-12 toward Delta-14, at a speed of 80 kph!\nBritannian Police 2: CCP to all mobile units. Declaring a Code 3 from floor 5 to floor 2. All units, take 2-8-8. I want the target intact!\nTV: Here's video footage of yesterday's terrorist bombings in Osaka. The secretary reported 59 casualties in this incident: 8 Britannians and 51 others...\nMan 1: You're out of time. From here on you'll make your moves every 20 seconds.\nNobleman: Very well, I'm game. Hm? Did your substitute arrive?\nMan 2: Thank heaven! I'm saved! Are things going well at school?\nNobleman: What have we here, schoolboys?\nLelouch: Hmpf. Well, look at this, a nobleman.\nNobleman: \nI envy you kids today. You have so much time on your hands. Time for regrets...what's your name?\nLelouch: Lelouch... Lamperouge.\nRivalz: \nWaoh! Now wait a minute! You can't win this one. It's impossible, right?\nLelouch: Rivalz, when do you think we would have to leave in order to make our next class?\nRivalz: Ah... 20 minutes if we bust our hump.\nLelouch: Then be sure that you drive safely on the way back.\nRivalz: Huh?\nLelouch: I'll need 9 minutes. By the way, about yesterday?\nMan 2: Understood, sir. We'll discuss it later.\nNobleman: 9 minutes? You only have 20 seconds per move.\nLelouch: Enough time.\nNobleman: \nHm? You start with the king?\nMilly: Where's Lelouch?\nShirley: He went somewhere with Rivalz.\nMilly: What! Maybe it's poker this time?\nShirley: They seem to forget that they're on the student council! They're off gambling for money! Lulu may be smart, yet he wastes his brain on stupid things! If only he'd apply himself in school, he'd get high grades!\nMilly: \"Oh, I wish my darling Lulu would be a serious young man!\"\nHow adorable is that?\nShirley: \nPlease, madam president...\nNagata: \nPerfect! After we finally steal this damn thing...! It's all because Tamaki couldn't stick to Naoto's plan. And now we've got a problem!\nRivalz: I love playing against the nobility! When they lose they always pay out of pride. By the way, 8 minutes 32 seconds is a new record!\nLelouch: \nHe also didn't have much time to move, either. And as opponents go, the nobles are tepid. They're just overprivileged parasites, that's all.\nRivalz: Well then, why don't you challenge one of the Elevens? They're nothing like us Britannians...\nMan: What are they trying to prove by killing innocent people?\nWoman: Those Elevens terrify me!\nTV: We apologize for the delay. Now His Royal Highness Prince Clovis, third prince of Britannia, will address the nation.\nClovis: To all my imperial subjects! Including of course the many cooperative Elevens who choose to serve the empire of Britannia!\nKallen: \nWe're not Elevens! We're Japanese!\nClovis: \nDo you not see my pain? My heart was ripped from my chest only to be torn apart! The remnants are filled with rage and sadness!\n However, as ruler of Area 11, I will not tolerate terrorism of any kind! Because the battle we fight is a righteous one, a virtuous battle to protect the well-being of one and all! Now then, everyone! I would like you to join me in observance of the eight who died for justice, in the line of duty.\nTV: A moment of silence, please.\nRivalz: Well, aren't you gonna join in?\nLelouch: Aren't you?\nRivalz: Heh... It's sort of embarrassing.\nLelouch: And I agree with you. Besides, spilling tears over those people won't bring them back to life now, will it.\nRivalz: Dang! That's dark, buddy.\nLelouch: It's all about self satisfaction. Doesn't matter how hard you try, you can't do it. There's no way you can change the world.\nWoman: \nYou were magnificent, Your Highness! One would never guess that you were attending a party while doing that!\nClovis: After all, the viceroy is the marquee actor of Area 11. I need to change costumes quickly.\nWoman: My! You're so self-confident!\nClovis: It's all in the performance. Since the media want a charismatic prince, I give them one.\nMan: Untrue! Prince Clovis, our key purpose in life is to support and assist your reign in any way we can!\nDiethard: His reign is a pathetic sham...\nBartley: Y-Your Highness!\nDiethard: Hmm? A soldier?\nClovis: Gad, how boorish of you!\nBartley: I beg your pardon, Your Highness. My Lord...\nDiethard: Not another appearance for him! Hope it's not as dreary...\nClovis: You fool!\nBartley: \nThe police were informed that it's medical equipment, that's all. If we scramble the army there'll be a record...\nClovis: Deploy the Royal Guard! The Knightmares as well!\nBritannian Army: Alert 1! Alert 1! 4th, 7th, and 8th rapid reaction companies, as well as the 31st air assault Team, immediate scramble! Special Division 9, stand by for deployment!\nRivalz: That first move you made...\nLelouch: Hm?\nRivalz: Why'd you start with the king?\nLelouch: If the king doesn't lead, how can he expect his subordinates to follow?\nRivalz: What's with that?\nLelouch: With what?\nRivalz: Do you fantasize about running a major corporation?\nLelouch: \nNo way. Ambitions like that will ruin your health...\nRivalz: Whoa! We're gonna die!\nNagata: You idiot! Watch where you're going!\nKallen: No! Not that way!\nRivalz: \nUh... Was that our fault?\nLelouch: I don't think so--\nBritannian Police 1: Control, the target has crashed at the abandoned V.O. building construction site.\nBritannian Police 2: The military will take over. General Bartley's command.\nBritannian Police 3: Him?!\nBartley: We have to retrieve it at all costs! That thing... in the wrong hands...!\nLelouch: What the...?\nRivalz: Oh man, this sucks! Looks like the power line on the bike got cut.\nLelouch: Yeah... Rivalz, come check this out.\nMan 1: Hey! Over here!\nMan 2: Woah! Nasty crash!\nWoman 1: What happened? Some sort of accident?\nMan 3: Probably a drunk driver...\nWoman 2: It's always some moron...\nMan 4: Hey, maybe somebody ought to go help?\nLelouch: All those idiots...!\nRivalz: Wait!\nGirl 1: What is it, an accident? Did a car crash?\nMan 5: Look, the student rescue team has arrived.\nGirl 2: Oh wow, I totally missed it.\nWoman 3: So like, why doesn't somebody call for help, you know?\nLelouch: Hey! Are you alright?\nRivalz: Yeah, yeah, I know it's the right thing to do, but I wish the guy would quit flaunting his pride and just give it a rest for a while. Now we're gonna be late to school!\nKallen: Nagata? Nagata!\nLelouch: Can you hear me? Are you okay?!\nC.C.: \nIt's you... Finally I have found my...\nLelouch: Where...? Are you in there?\nLelouch: Stop! I'm in here!\nRivalz: So, would you call that a hit and run?\nLelouch: You'd think they'd stick a ladder on the inside, too.\nBritannian Army: Stop the vehicle! Surrender now and you'll get the chance to defend yourself in court! Stop and surrender at once! Give up now or we'll shoot to kill!\nNagata: Now what do we do?! That's the army!\nKallen: Have you forgotten? That's what I'm here for!\nLelouch: If I jump out, I have the choice of breaking my neck or getting shot. I can try to call--\nKallen: \nCan you enter the subway via the Azabu route?\nNagata: Kallen! Let's use it here! Why not?\nKallen: \nBecause that would mean a blood bath!\nNagata: You're right.\nLelouch: I've seen her before.\nRivalz: Lelouch, come on! Where are you? We've gotta get to schoool!\nBritannian Army 1: Target is moving from the settlement toward the ghetto.\nBritannian Army 2: Copy that! Corner 'em!\nBritannian Army 1: Roger!\nBritannian Army 3: \nA Slash Harken?! A Knightmare!\nLelouch: Crap! These guys are real terrorists!\nKallen: You fellas know full well what this badass mother can do!\nJeremiah: \nThe rest of you, back off. I'll take this guy. I can only assume you dug that obsolete relic out of some scrap heap. An over the hill Glasgow is no match for a Sutherland! Not to mention a filthy Eleven who spurns the compassion of our glorious Emperor!\nNagata: Kallen, we should both split up! Both of us can't risk being killed! Run for it!\nKallen: But...!\nVilletta: Simpleminded Eleven.\nKallen: \nNo way?! It's stuck...!\nJeremiah: Secondhand junk! I will admit! I really like your spirit. However...!\nLelouch: No cell phone reception. We're out of range. Judging from the darkness and road surface, we must be driving along the old subway lines. They're heading for an exit somewhere in the ghetto. Getting out would be dangerous. Still... Okay, I've got it. I'm not big on military but I'll take their protection. If I give them a terrorist communicator...Oh, wait. I forgot...\nRivalz: Some friend... Leaving me behind like that!\nLloyd: Ah-ha!\nBartley: What are you doing?!\nLloyd: Looking at a man who blundered... Am I right?\nBartley: Why, you...!\nLloyd: You really screwed this one up. Terrorists came along and stole whatever it was that you and Prince Clovis were secretly working on. Retrieving it is simple, but you want to sweep up all of their compatriots in addition. Let the terrorists go and you can find their hideout, too. Congratulations! Your reasoning was spot on!\nCecile: It was nothing. I just thought it was strange...\nBartley: Okay, that's enough. What is it the Special Corps wants out of this?\nLloyd: \nI'm merely saying that I'd like to assist with the cleanup!\nBartley: To assist?\nLloyd: Correct. Because it's data I want.\nCecile: Excuse me, but what in the world have they just stolen, anyway?\nBartley: \nChemical weapons. In other words... Poison gas.\nRoyal Guard: The terrorists are hiding in the subway system. Your mission is to locate the weapon that they've stolen. Investigate the old subway system that runs through the Eleven residential district in the Shinjuku Ghetto. Report in the moment you spot them. Recovery of the target will be handled by us, the Royal Guard. \nYou people bear the honorary title of Britannians now, but you were born Elevens! Therefore the stench of these monkeys oughta be a familiar one! If you want to earn the right to carry arms, then show some results! This is your opportunity to show your loyalty to Britannia!\nBritannian Army: Yes, my lord!\nLelouch: An accident?! Or else...\nNagata: The tire's stuck... Please, Ohgi... Find me...!\nBritannian Army: 4-0-4 has sighted the target.\nRoyal Guard: Roger. Prepare for recovery.\nLelouch: \nNow I can use this chance to climb up...\nAre you Britannian...?\nSuzaku: That's enough mindless murder!\nLelouch: Wait! I'm not one of...!\nSuzaku: Planning to use poison gas! Don't play dumb with me!\nLelouch: Get off me...! I'm not here by choice. \nAnd if that's poison gas, it was made in Britannia, wasn't it?!\nSuzaku: My god...!\nLelouch: Mindless murder?! Then why don't you just obliterate Britannia!\nSuzaku: Lelouch? It's me, Suzaku.\nLelouch: You... you became a Britannian soldier?\nSuzaku: Yeah. And what about you? You're a...\nLelouch: What are you saying?!\nSuzaku: \nThat's not poison gas...? What is it?!\nKallen: In all the confusion, I left it in the coat.\nOhgi: It's okay. The Glassgow's circuits are usable. So, were we right?\nKallen: Think so. I bet it's poison gas, like Intelligence said.\nOhgi: And Nagata?\nKallen: I don't know. I think he made it underground.\nLelouch: Tell me the truth, Suzaku. Poison gas? This girl?\nSuzaku: Hey, it's what they told us in the briefing. I swear!\nRoyal Guard: Stinking monkey! Being an honorary Britannian will not excuse you!\nSuzaku: But sir, I was told this was poison gas!\nRoyal Guard: How dare you question orders!\nLelouch: \nThis is bad. A poisonous situation which would pose a threat to Suzaku's superiors if it's unleashed.\nRoyal Guard: However, in light of your outstanding military achievements I'm going to be lenient. Private Kururugi, take this and execute the terrorist.\nSuzaku: But he's not a terrorist! He's a civilian who got caught up in all this!\nRoyal Guard: You insubordinate little...! That's an order. Didn't you swear your loyalty and your life to Britannia?!\nSuzaku: Yes, but... but I can't.\nRoyal Guard: What?\nSuzaku: I won't do it, sir. I won't shoot a civilian. I can't follow your orders, sir.\nRoyal Guard: \nVery well.\nLelouch: Suzaku!\nRoyal Guard: Well, Britannian schoolboy, not a good day to cut class. Collect the girl. After you've secured her, kill the student!\nBritannian Army: Yes, my lord!\nNagata: \nDeath to... Britannia... Long live Japan!\nBartley: They got away?! And you call yourselves the Royal Guard?!\nRoyal Guard: Forgive me, my lord! The blast was mainly directed upwards, but the--\nBartley: Why the hell do you think I only told you people about this?!\nRoyal Guard: W- We'll continue the investigation!\nClovis: The plan has moved forward to the next phase.\nBartley: But, but Your Highness...!\nClovis: \nIf knowledge of her gets out, I'll be disinherited. Tell them back home we're carrying out a planned urban renewal here. As Clovis, third prince of the empire, I command you! Destroy Shinjuku Ghetto! Leave no one alive!\nMan: Why are they doing this?!\nWoman: Dear, let's go!\nMan: Hurry!\nBritannian Army 1: Okay, let's sweep next floor.\nBritannian Army 2: The enemy is garbage that can never hope to become even honorary Britannians! Wipe out every last one of them!\nJeremiah: Naturally.\nBritannian Army 3: Supervisor Jeremiah, General Bartley requests that you take command of--\nJeremiah: Bartley has staff officers.

Not only that, but Britannia has even killed Suzaku!\nLloyd: Not there?\nCecile: It looks like he's gone to the front line.\nLloyd: Even though we brought the Lancelot here?\nCecile: Now what'll we do?\nLloyd: We steamrolled our way in here, but we don't have a devicer to use it.\nLelouch: Stay quiet. Wait here.\nRoyal Guard: \nReport.\nBritannian Army: We found only Elevens here, sir.\nRoyal Guard: You're sure of it? That exit comes out here?\nBritannian Army: Yes, sir. It matches up with our map of the old city.\nShirley: \nHuh? That jerk! He hung up on me ! I can't believe it!\nRoyal Guard: What an appropriate location for a terrorist to meet his end.\nLelouch: You scum...!\nRoyal Guard: \nStill, you did well for a student, but that's to be expected. You're a Britannian. Unfortunately, my clever young friend, you have no future.\nC.C.: He mustn't die!\nLelouch: You shot her!\nRoyal Guard: Our orders were to bring her back alive if possible. Oh well, nothing can be done about it now. We'll tell our superiors that the Royal Guard found the terrorist hideout and killed them all. Regrettably the female hostage had already been tortured to death. What do you think, schoolboy?\nLelouch: How can this be happening? First Suzaku's killed...and this girl...now, I'm about to die.

That's impossible!\nC.C.: If I grant you power, could you go on? I propose a deal. In exchange for this power you must agree to make my one wish come true. Accept this contract and you accept its conditions, while living in the world of humans, you will live unlike any other. A different providence, a different time, a different life. \nThe power of the king will condemn you to a life of solitude. Are you prepared for this?\nCharles: A convergence with the Ragnarok connection? So the myth is beginning once again?\nLelouch: \nYes! I hereby accept the terms of your contract! Say...how should a Britannian who detests his own country live his life?\nRoyal Guard: Are you some kind of radical?\nLelouch: What's wrong? Why not shoot? Your opponent is just a schoolboy. Or have you finally realized? The only ones who should kill are those who are prepared to be killed.\nRoyal Guard: What's happening here...?!\nLelouch: \nI, Lelouch vi Britannia, command you...now all of you...die!\nRoyal Guard: Happily, Your Highness! Fire!\nLelouch: That was the turning point. Since that day, I've lived a lie. The lie of living. My name too was a lie. My personal history, a lie. Nothing but lies. I was sick to death of a world that couldn't be changed. But even in my lies, I refused to give up in despair. But now this incredible power...it's mine...well, then...",

The puppet breaks into\na dance, a beautiful and intricate balletic piece. Soon the\npuppet is leaping and tumbling through space, moves that one\nwould think impossible for a marionette. Sweat appears on\nthe real Craig's brow. His fingers move like lightning. The\npuppet moves faster and faster. Sweat appears on the puppet's\nbrow. We see that the sweat is being piped from a special\ndevice that the real Craig controls. The Craig puppet\ncollapses on the floor of the stage. It puts its hands up to\nits face and weeps.

I must\ninform you that I find that highly\narousing.\nLOTTE\nNo, you don't understand. I've been\ninside Malkovich when I'm with\nMaxine...\nLESTER\n(slaps Lotte furiously)\nWhat?! That is not allowed. My God,\nyou are supposed to be one of us.\nYou know you must never partake of\nMalkovich by yourself!\nLOTTE\nNo, I didn't know that.\nLESTER\nOh, didn't anyone show you the\nindoctrination video?\nLOTTE\nNo.\nLESTER\nOh, sorry. Right this way.\nCUT TO:\nINT. SCREENING ROOM - NIGHT\nLotte site next to Lester in the darkened auditorium.\nThe projector whirs. The screen lights up.\nTITLE: SO YOU WANT TO BE JOHN MALKOVICH\nA much younger Lester addresses the camera in this black\nand white film, which seems to have been made in the 50's.\nLESTER ON FILM\nWelcome, my fellow Malkovichians.\nAs you may already know, today a\nbaby was born into this sad world.\nWe see a shot of a newborn.\nLESTER ON FILM (CONT'D)\nHis name is John Horatio Hannibal\nMalkovich. And we are the keepers\nof the door to his soul. One day,\nwhen his brain is big enough, we\nwill all journey into his head and\nlive there for all eternity. Following\nthe teachings of our leader Karl Marx,\nwe will build the ultimate communist\ncommunity, one body and hundreds,\nmaybe thousands, of brains inside\nworking together to form a super\nhuman intellect capable of curing\ndisease, stopping all war, and\nruling the world with a benevolent\nfist. We will take a wife, a woman\nof uncommon beauty and intellect, who\nis, as yet, still an infant herself.\nWe see a photo of another infant, this one with a ribbon in\nher hair.\nLESTER ON FILM (CONT'D)\nHer name is Floris Horatia Hannibella\nDeMent.\nLOTTE\nDoes Floris know that she's the\nchosen?\nLESTER\nWell, I tried to explain it to her,\nbut...\nLester points to his ear and shrugs.\nCUT TO:\nINT. MALKOVICH'S BEDROOM - NIGHT\nMalkovich and Maxine lie naked on the bed, looking quite\nrelaxed.\nMAXINE\nYou still there, sweets?\nMALKOVICH\nYeah. I've figured out how to hold\non as long as I want. Oddly enough,\nit's all in the wrists.\nMAXINE\nWow.\n(little girl pout)\nDo a puppet show for me, Craig honey.\nMALKOVICH\nYou mean with Malkovich?\nMAXINE\nI'd love to see your work.\nMALKOVICH\n(pleased)\nReally? Yeah. Okay.\nMalkovich leans over and kisses her, then gets up.\nMALKOVICH (CONT'D)\nI'll do something I call \"Craig's\nDance of Despair and Disillusionment.\"\nMalkovich performs the same dance that the Craig pupper\ndid at the beginning of the film. It is exactly the same,\ncomplete with impossible somersaults and perspiring brow.\nHe finishes by falling to his knees and weeping.\nMAXINE\n(moved)\nThat was incredible. You're brilliant!\nMALKOVICH\nYou see, Maxine, it isn't just playing\nwith dolls.\nMAXINE\nYou're right, my darling, it's\nso much more. It's playing with\npeople!\nMalkovich kisses Maxine. She snuggles close to him.\nMAXINE\nStay in him forever?\nMALKOVICH\n(as Malkovich, screaming)\nNo!\n(as Craig, calmly)\nBut how will we make a living,\nmy love, if our clientele doesn't\nhave access to our product?\nMAXINE\nWell, we'll have all the money in\nMalkovich's bank account, plus he\nstill gets acting work occasionally.\nMALKOVICH\n(as Malkovich, breaking through)\nNo! Please!\n(as Craig, to Malkovich)\nShut up, will you? We're trying to\nthink here.\n(to Maxine)\nIt is sort of like being a puppeteer.\nI like that about it.\nMAXINE\nNo one would ever have to know its\nnot him.\nMALKOVICH\n(an idea)\nWait a minute! What if everybody knew?\nWhat if we presented Malkovich as the\nworld's most complicated puppet and\nme as the only puppeteer sophisticated\nenough to work him? We'd wipe the floor\nwith the Great Mantini!\nMAXINE\nOh, Craiggy, that's brilliant!\nCUT TO:\nINT. LESTER'S SHRINE ROOM - NIGHT\nThe worshippers are assembled. Lotte stands before them.\nLOTTE\nI have sinned, unwittingly, against\nthe community. And for this I am\ntruly sorry.\nMAN #2\nW-w-what's it like on the inside?\nLOTTE\nOh, it's glorious. It's indescribable.\nMAN #2\nOooh, I wanna go. I wanna go. I say\nit's time.\nLESTER\nPerhaps you're right, Terry. We're\nall prepared, and perhaps this\nSchwartz fellow is forcing our hand\na bit. We will enter the portal\ntonight!\nEveryone cheers.\nCUT TO:\nINT. CRAIG AND MAXINE'S OFFICE - NIGHT\nMaxine and Malkovich are furiously filling the portal\nwith cement. Suddenly Malkovich stops and runs to the\noffice door screaming a bloodcurdling scream. He stops\njust as suddenly, begins to strangle himself.\nMALKOVICH\n(Craig to Malkovich)\nShut up!\n(to Maxine)\nSorry, dear, I lost control for\na minute.\nMAXINE\n(kissing him)\nIt's okay, my sweet.\nThey go back to filling the portal. There is the sound\nof many shuffling feet in the hallway. The door flies\nopen and the Malkovichians led by Lester and Lotte burst\nin. Malkovich and Maxine turn with a start.\nLESTER\nAaaahhhh, the portal!\nLOTTE\n(to Malkovich)\nYou bastard!\nLotte lunges for Malkovich. Lester grabs her arm, holds\nher back.\nLESTER\nNo! Don't harm the vessel!\nLOTTE\nIt's Craig in there, I can tell.\nLESTER\nI understand, but we must protect\nthe vessel at all costs.\n(to Malkovich)\nPlease, Craig, please step aside\nand allow us to have what is\nrightfully ours.\nCRAIG\nSquatter's rights, Lester.\nCraig laughs somewhat maniacally. Maxine slips her arm\nthrough Craig's, joins him in his laughter, and glances\ntriumphantly over at Lotte.\nMAXINE\nNow excuse us, we have an\nentertainment legend to create.\nLESTER\n(to the cult members)\nClear the way for them, my friends.\nThey will be dealt with in due time.\nThe Malkovichians grumble and let Malkovich and Maxine\nexit.\nLESTER (CONT'D)\nNow, let's see what we can do to\nsalvage this portal... for the sake\nof all that is good.\nThe Malkovichians converge on the sealed portal, and\nbegin clawing desperately at the quick-drying cement.\nFingers are scraped raw, and we see smears of blood and\nskin on the rough gray surface.\nCUT TO:\nINT. AGENT'S OFFICE - DAY\nA slick-looking agent answers a buzzing phone.\nAGENT\nOf course, send him right in. Don't\never keep him waiting again. Do you\nunderstand?\nMalkovich and Maxine enter. The agent stands, holds out\nhis hand.\nAGENT (CONT'D)\nJohn! Great to see you! Sorry about\nthe cunt at reception.\nMALKOVICH\nThis is my fiancee Maxine.\nThe agent shakes Maxine's hand.\nAGENT\nGreat to see you, Maxine. Sorry about\nthe cunt at reception. Please have a\nseat.\nMalkovich and Maxine sit.\nAGENT (CONT'D)\nCan I get you anything? Coffee? Water?\nMAXINE\nNo thanks.\nAGENT\n(into phone)\nTeresa, get me a chicken soup.\n(to Malkovich and Maxine)\nChicken soup?\nMaxine and Malkovich shake their heads \"no.\"\nMALKOVICH\nI'll get right to the point, Larry.\nI'm a puppet now...\nAGENT\nOkay.\nMALKOVICH\nI'm being controlled by the world's\ngreatest puppeteer, Craig Schwartz...\nAGENT\n(no clue)\nOh yeah, he's good.\nMALKOVICH\n... and I want to show off his skills\nby performing a one-puppet\nextravaganza in Reno.\nMAXINE\nVegas.\nMALKOVICH\nVegas. Can you arrange that?\nAGENT\nSure, sure. Just let me make a\ncouple of calls.\nCUT TO:\nINT. CRAIG AND MAXINE'S OFFICE - DAY\nThe cult members are still there, now with picks\nshovels. They are worn out and sweaty. The portal is\nexcavated, but it seems ragged and destroyed. Man #2\nemerges from the hole, a rope tied around his waist.\nMAN #2\nThat's the last of it, boss.\nLester peers through the door.\nLESTER\nWell, let's see what we've got\nhere.\nLester crawls into the tunnel, the door slams behind\nhim.\nCUT TO:\nINT. PORTAL - CONTINUOUS\nLester crawls through. There is a slurping sound and a\nflash of light.\nCUT TO:\nINT. BUNKER - DAY\nThe scene is in black and white. Bombs are dropping.\nThere is a blonde in forties clothes there. Lester\nviews the scene through somebody's POV.\nLESTER (V.O.)\nMy God, where am I? This seems so\nfamiliar.\nThe person walks past a mirror. It's Hitler.\nLESTER (V.O.)\nMy God, I'm Hitler in the bunker!\nAaaahhhh! Aaaah!\nDIRECTOR\nCut!\nWe look over to see a director and camera crew.\nLESTER (V.O.)\nOh, I'm just the actor in that\nTwilight Zone episode.\nThere is a popping sound.\nCUT TO:\nEXT. DITCH - DAY\nLester pops into the ditch. One of his cult members is\nwaiting with a car, and looking hopeful. Lester sadly\nshakes his head \"no.\"\nCUT TO:\nINT. LESTER'S SHRINE ROOM - DAY\nThe cult members mill about, drinking coffee, chatting.\nLester enters with the cult member who picked him up at\nthe ditch. All quiet down and look over at him.\nLESTER\nThank you all for your efforts,\nbut I'm afraid we can no longer get\ninto Malkovich through the portal.\nLOTTE\n(panicky)\nWhy not? I need to get in there!\nLESTER\nI'm not certain, my dear, but I\nbelieve your husband has somehow\npsychically diverted the route.\nLOTTE\nThat bastard! I'll gladly dispose\nof him in the name of the order, Son\nof Malkovich.\nLESTER\nI'm afraid that no physical harm\nmust come to him as long as he\ninhabits the vessel.\nMAN #3\n(raises hand)\nOooh, I got an idea! What if we\nbuild another portal to Malkovich,\nlike around back, and sneak in that\nway?\nMAN #4\nOnly Captain Mertin knew how to build\na portal, dummy, and he's dead!\nLESTER\nActually, my friends, I suppose its\ntime I told you, I'm Captain James\nMertin.\nThe members fall into a stunned silence. Lester takes\nsome refrigerator magnets and spells out L-E-S-T-E-R on\na board. He then rearranges them for a while.\nLESTER (CONT'D)\nYou see, Lester is an anagram for\nMertin.\nLester continues to rearrange the letters, getting a little\ntense now.\nLESTER (CONT'D)\nIt used to work, I'm sure of it.\nSeveral members check their watches.\nLESTER (CONT'D)\nOh, damn it to hell. Anyway, I am.\nL-E-S-T-E-R has been left as E-L R-E-S-T as Lester turns\nfrom the board to face the congregation.\nMAN #3\nHow can this be? I thought you were\nonly one hundred and five years old.\nMertin would have to be...\nLESTER\n(chuckles amiably)\nI'm two hundred and five, truth be\ntold.\nWOMAN #1\n(flirtatiously)\nYou don't look a day over one\nhundred and five, Captain. What's\nyour secret?\nLESTER\nLots of carrot juice, little lady.\nThat, and a deal with the Devil.\nThere is a lot of murmuring in the room now.\nMAN #2\nSo what exactly are you saying? Are\nwe in cahoots with the Dark Master\nhere?\nLESTER\nSurprise.\nThe cultists get tense, start to leave en masse.\nLESTER (CONT'D)\nWait! It's not that bad! When we get\ninto Malkovich, we still get to rule\nthe world, just like I told you. The\nonly difference is that we rule in the\nname of evil, instead of good.\nPeople stop in their tracks.\nMAN #3\nThat's the only difference?\nLESTER\nAbsolutely.\nThe cultists think about is, then shrug and stay put.\nLESTER (CONT'D)\nSo anyway...\nLotte stands.\nLOTTE\nWell, I for one, am resigning. I will\nnot serve evil. I am ashamed of all\nof you.\nLotte heads for the door.\nLESTER\nMy dear, let me assure you that when\nwe attain power, it will be much more\npleasant for those inside Malkovich,\nthan for those outside.\nLotte stops and turns.\nLOTTE\nI'll take my chances.\nShe exits.\nLESTER\nAnybody else?\nWOMAN #1\nDo we get to wear a crown?\nLESTER\nBut of course.\nWOMAN #1\nCount me in.\nLESTER\nGood. I think its time to beckon\nMr. Flemmer. Perhaps He can help us\nout of this pickle.\nFLIP TO:\nINT. LESTER'S SHRINE ROOM - A BIT LATER\nMr. Flemmer, a silver-haired gentleman in turtleneck and\nblazer, scratches his head. The cultists patiently watch\nhim.\nFLEMMER\nBoy, this is a toughie. To be honest,\nI didn't anticipate this.\nLESTER\nAnd as I said, sir, we can't very\nwell exert physical persuasion upon\nthe sacred vessel Malkovich.\nFLEMMER\nRight, Lester. I heard you the first\ntime. I'm not a dummy.\nLESTER\nDidn't mean to imply that you were,\nsir.\nFLEMMER\nLook, I'm going back to my house\nto ponder this. So stay calm and\nkeep track of Schwartz's comings\nand goings. Oh, and somebody dispose\nof Schwartz's wife, will you?\n(to cultists)\nNice to meet you all.\nThe cult members ad-lib \"same here, sir.\"\nCUT TO:\nINT. CRAIG AND LOTTE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT\nLotte site in the living room, in her pajamas, softly\nsobbing. The caged animals watch her.\nLOTTE\nOh, my friends. Be thankful you're\nnot human. People are treacherous\nand greedy and corrupt. I've lost\nmy heart to two of them and I almost\nlost my soul to another. And I'm no\nbetter. Look at the way I keep you,\nlocked in cages, for my own enjoyment.\nWell, I've been in a cage too, my\nfriends. Literally and figuratively.\nSo tonight I set you free.\nLotte opens the windows and the front door, then unlocks\nall the cages. The animals scurry and fly out of their\ncages, and out of the house. Lotte watches silently until\nshe is alone.\nLOTTE (CONT'D)\nGood-bye, friends.\nA hand reaches for hers. She looks down. Elijah is still\nthere and holding her hand. She smiles.\nLOTTE (CONT'D)\nHello, friend\nCUT TO:\nEXT. CITY STREET - NIGHT\nWe see the menagerie of animals on the otherwise deserted\nstreet, dispersing into the night. A lone dark figure turns\nthe corner, and walks slowly up the street to Craig and\nLotte's building.\nCUT TO:\nINT. CRAIG AND LOTTE'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS\nLotte and Elijah see the dark figure coming up the steps.\nThe buzzer rings. Lotte and Elijah jump.\nLOTTE\nThey've come to kill me, Elijah. See,\nI know too much. I should get the\ndoor. It's impolite to keep death\nwaiting.\nElijah looks at her sweetly, a great sadness in his eyes.\nThen he leads her by the hand out the window.\nCUT TO:\nEXT. VEGAS HOTEL - NIGHT\nThe marquee reads: World's Greatest Puppeteer Craig\nSchwartz and his Magical Puppet John Malkovich.\nCUT TO:\nINT. DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT\nMalkovich sits in a tuxedo and watches himself in the\ndressing table mirror. Maxine, in a tight black number,\nreclines on the couch.\nMAXINE\nThis is it, lover. You're stepping\nonto that stage a nobody and\npresto-change-o, you're coming\nback the greatest puppeteer the\nworld has ever seen.\nMALKOVICH\nI'm nervous. Malkovich is fighting\nme hard today.\nMalkovich jerks a bit, gets it under control.\nMAXINE\nDoesn't he know how important\ntonight is to us?\nMALKOVICH\nHe's a selfish bastard.\nCUT TO:\nINT. LAS VEGAS THEATER - NIGHT\nThe house is filling with formally dressed audience members.\nThe cultists and Lester, also in tuxes and gowns, are among\nthem. The lights go down.\nANNOUNCER (O.S.)\nLadies and gentlemen, it is the\ngreat privilege of the Luxor hotel\nand Casino to present Craig Schwartz\nand his magical puppet John\nMalkovich.\nThe orchestra starts up. The curtains part.\nLESTER\nBlasphemous bastard.\nMalkovich tap dances out onto the stage. He is amazingly\nnimble and the audience \"oohs\" and \"aahs.\"\nLESTER (CONT'D)\n(grudgingly)\nPretty good though.\nMalkovich does an amazing triple somersault, lands on one\nknee and, with spread arms, begins singing: \"Kiss Today\nGoodbye.\" in a beautiful tenor. The orchestra catches up\nwith him. The audience goes wild. A pretty-boy young man\nwith a big tousle of black hair and a shiny, tight suit\nappears at the back of the house. An usher glances over at\nhim.\nUSHER\nOh, Mr. Mantini! We weren't expecting\nyou tonight, sir. Um, I'm afraid\nthere's not an empty seat in the\nentire house.\nMANTINI\n(not taking his eyes from the stage)\nMake one empty.\nUSHER\nY-y-y-es sir.\nThe usher looks nervously around for someone to boot.\nMartini waits in the back. On stage, Malkovich is now\nperforming the \"back of the car scene\" from \"On The\nWaterfront.\" He alternates between the Marlon Brando part\nand the Rod Steiger part, moving back and forth from one\nstool to the another. He performs it magnificently. We see\nLester in the audience wiping a small tear from his eye.\nLESTER\nNot too shabby.\nMantini is now sitting in a good aisle seat next to a\nbeautiful woman. Her boyfriend is being hauled toward the\nexit by the usher. The beautiful woman watches, with some\nconcern, as the boyfriend is taken away. Then she turns and\nsmiles flirtatiously at Mantini. Mantini smiles back. On\nstage Malkovich is dressed in a ringmaster's outfit and\njuggling chainsaws.\nMANTINI\nNothing more than a Goddamn clown.\nAt this point the entire audience stands and gives Malkovich\na spontaneous standing ovation. All except Mantini. Even the\ncultists get up.\nCUT TO:\nINT. SEWER - NIGHT\nLotte sits sadly in the wet tunnel. She is scrunched-up\nagainst the damp cold. A small fire smolders in front of\nher. We hear footsteps approaching. It is Elijah, carrying\nsupplies: food and blankets. He covers her with a blanket\nand sits down next to her.\nLOTTE\nThey're going to take over the\nworld, Elijah. Evil will reign.\nBut, then, evil already reigns,\ndoesn't it? So what difference\ndoes it make if John Malkovich\nis wearing the fucking crown while\nit's reigning?\nElijah sighs, then holds his stomach. The ulcer is\nreturning.\nCUT TO:\nINT. FLEMMER'S APARTMENT - DAY\nIt's a conservatively furnished upper westside apartment.\nLooks like it belongs to a Columbia professor. The walls\nare lined with books. Mr. Flemmer sits at his desk, his\nhead in his hands, deep in thought. The doorbell rings.\nFLEMMER\nIt's open.\nThe door opens and Lester pokes his head in.\nLESTER\nIt's just me, boss. I brought\ncroissants.\nLester enters with a greasy white paper bag.\nFLEMMER\nHave a seat. I wracking my brain\nover this Malkovich thing.\nLESTER\nWe saw his show at the Luxor last\nnight.\nFLEMMER\n(impressed)\nVegas? What'd you think?\nLESTER\nThe kid's got talent. You've never\nseen Malkovich like this. Schwartz\nhad him up there singing and dancing.\nImpressions.\nFLEMMER\nImpressions? Those are hard.\nLESTER\nVery talented son of a bitch. Too bad\nwe can't kill him.\nFLEMMER\nI suppose I could come to him in a\ndream. I don't know. That's the best\nI can think of right now.\nLESTER\nA scary dream?\nFLEMMER\nNo, a sexy dream. Of course, a scary\ndream.\nLESTER\n(noncommittally)\nI like that.\nCUT TO:\nINT. HOTEL SUITE - NIGHT\nMalkovich sits on the floor in silk pajamas. He is\nsurrounded by newspaper clippings. He is drinking\nchampagne from the bottle. Maxine is at a dressing\ntable, brushing her hair.\nMALKOVICH\nThey love me, darling! \"Craig Schwartz\nis fantastic!\" The New York Times.\n\"If only Craig Schwartz had always\nbeen inside Malkovich!\" Women's Wear\nDaily. \"Craig Schwartz - The world's\ngreatest puppeteer!\" Paul Wunder,\nWBAI Radio.\nMAXINE\nOh, darling.

Why\ndon't you climb into bed, and I'll\nmeet you there in just...\nBut Malkovich is already passed out on the floor on top of\nhis clippings. Maxine smiles maternally, gets up and puts\nblanket over him. We stay on Malkovich's face.\nDISSOLVE TO:\nINT. HELL - NIGHT\nCraig wanders across a jagged, rocky landscape. Geysers of\nflame shoot up around him. The sky is red. He is frightened.\nHe arrives at a desk. The man behind the desk is facing away\nfrom him. He swivels to face Craig. It is Flemmer, looking\nthe same as usual except for little red horns and a sinister\ngrin.\nCRAIG\nWho are you?\nFLEMMER\nI am the Devil.\nCRAIG\nOh.\nFLEMMER\nLeave Malkovich. He is mine.\nCRAIG\nOkay. Sorry. I didn't know.\nCUT TO:\nINT. HOTEL SUITE - CONTINUOUS\nMalkovich awakes with a start. Maxine looks over at him.\nMAXINE\nBad dream, darling?\nMALKOVICH\nI've got to leave Malkovich.\nMAXINE\nYou've got to be kidding.\nMALKOVICH\nI just had the most horrifying\nnightmare. The devil was in it.\nFlemmer crouches behind a bureau and listens. He is pleased\nwith himself.\nMAXINE\nMalkovich is our meal ticket. You\ncan't back out because of some\nstupid dream.\nFLEMMER\n(to himself)\nShit.\nMALKOVICH\nHoney, we can be happy and poor\ntogether.\nMAXINE\n(laughs derisively)\nPerhaps you'll want to consult that\nOuija board again.\nThere is a knock at the door. Maxine opens it, angry.\nMAXINE (CONT'D)\nYeah what?!\nMALKOVICH\nDerek Mantini!\nMantini enters. Maxine is suddenly interested. Mantini and\nMaxine give each other the once over.\nMANTINI\n(still eyeing Maxine)\nHello, Schwartz. I saw your show.\nMALKOVICH\nDid you see the reviews?\nMANTINI\nYeah, I saw them\nMALKOVICH\nBecause if you missed any, I just\nhappen to have copies here you can\ntake with you when you leave now.\nMAXINE\nI'm Maxine. I produced the evening\nwith Malkovich.\nMANTINI\nVery impressive. I could use a\nproducer with your vision. And\nother outstanding attributes.\nMALKOVICH\nShe's not available.\nMANTINI\nWe'll see, Schwartz. We'll see.\nMAXINE\nYeah, we'll see, Schwartz. We'll see.\nMANTINI\nI won't waste your time Schwartz, or\nmore importantly, mine. Here's my\nproposal: There's only room in this\nworld for one \"World's Greatest\nPuppeteer.\" Correct? So let's allow\nthe puppet-going public to crown\ntheir king.\nMALKOVICH\nHow do we do that?\nMANTINI\nA friendly competition, if you will.\nYour Malkovich puppet and my Harry S.\nTruman puppet appear opposite each\nother in a play. Not some Vegas\nBurly-Q pyrotechnics, but a real play\nthat requires actual acting. The\naudience decides who is more deserving\nof the title. The losing puppeteer\nbows out graciously. Goes back to\nobscurity as a file clerk.\nMALKOVICH\nWhat's the play?\nMANTINI\nSay... \"Equus\"? It's got everything.\nMALKOVICH\nNever heard of it.\nMANTINI\nBroadway's finest three hours. It's\nabout the suppression of the\nindividual. Conformity as God in\nmodern society.\nMALKOVICH\nSounds boring. Are there any songs?\nMANTINI\nNothing but acting to hide behind,\nbuddy-boy.\nMALKOVICH\nI'm not afraid. I toured for a year\nwith the National Puppet Company's\nproduction of \"Long Day's Journey\nInto Night.\"\nMANTINI\nGreat then.\nMALKOVICH\nIs there dancing?\nMANTINI\nNo.\nMALKOVICH\nWho needs dancing?\nCUT TO:\nINT. FLEMMER'S APARTMENT - DAY\nLester is watering Flemmer's plants. A key is heard in the\ndoor. Flemmer enters, a small carry-on bag slung over his\nshoulder.\nLESTER\nHow'd it go? Did you say the\nphilodendron gets water or no?\nFLEMMER\nNo, for God's sake, I just watered\nit yesterday.\n(beat)\nIt almost went well. I gave a pretty\ngood dream, but circumstances arose.\nLESTER\nWhat kind of circumstances?\nFLEMMER\nMaxine says she'll leave him if he\nleaves Malkovich, plus he's been\nchallenged to a puppet-duel by\nMantini.\nLESTER\nThe Great Mantini?\nFLEMMER\nNo, the Mediocre Mantini. Of course\nthe Great Mantini!\nLESTER\nOh, he's good! Great, actually. I\nsaw him do \"Tru\" with his sixty\nfoot Robert Morse puppet. Sensational.\nFLEMMER\nBut I think I have another plan.\nLESTER\n(snippy)\nDo tell. I love a good plan.\nFLEMMER\nWhy are you being like this?\nLester shrugs.\nLESTER\nI missed you. I'm sorry. Tell me\nthe plan.\nFLEMMER\nWell, if Mantini wins, Schwartz will\nleave Malkovich, right? So, if he\nneeds it, I help Mantini's performance\na bit, give him an edge. Spice up the\nshow.\nLESTER\nCan you do that? I mean, do you know\nanything about puppetry?\nFLEMMER\nI am the Devil, Lester. I think I can\nhandle it.\nLESTER\nI was just asking. No disrespect\nintended.\nFLEMMER\nFine. Let's drop it.\nLESTER\nFine. I mean, it's not like I was\ndoubting you, it's just that I know\npuppetry is a skill that takes a long\ntime to acquire.\nFLEMMER\nFine. I'm not mad. Let's just drop it.\nLESTER\nFine.

BROADHURST THEATER - NIGHT\nThe house is packed. On stage is a minimalist set: wood\nplanks and metal poles. Six guys in brown turtlenecks and\nstylized wire horse heads mill about. The 60 foot Harry S.\nTruman puppet is pacing, his strings extending up into the\nflyspace and out of sight. Malkovich sits on a bench. Truman\nand Malkovich both take stabs at British accents.\nHARRY S. TRUMAN PUPPET\nDo you dream often?\nMALKOVICH\nDo you?\nHARRY S. TRUMAN PUPPET\nIt's my job to ask the questions.\nYours to answer them.\nMALKOVICH\nSays who?\nHARRY S. TRUMAN PUPPET\nSays me.

Wooden?\nSecond couple:\nTHEATERGOER #3\nWhat's with the Malkovich puppet?\nHe was much better in Vegas when he\nplayed the piano with his feet.\nTHEATERGOER #4\nI hate it when they try to stretch.\nIt's like Woody Allen.\nThird couple:\nTHEATERGOER #5\nThey both stink! I'm going across the\nstreet to second act Miss Saigon.\nCUT TO:\nINT. DRESSING ROOM - A FEW MINUTES LATER\nMalkovich watches himself in his dressing table mirror.\nMaxine enters, flops herself down on the couch and lights\nup a cigarette.\nMAXINE\nYou'd better turn on the pyrotechnics,\nlover, cause right now you're running\nneck and neck with the dead president.\nAnd you're both in last place.\nMalkovich continues to watch himself in the mirror, nods his\nhead.\nCUT TO:\nINT. CATWALK ABOVE STAGE - CONTINUOUS\nMantini leans against a rail and smokes a cigarette. Charles\nNelson Reilly, in a tuxedo, confers with him in hushed tones.\nCHARLES NELSON REILLY\nYou're doing beautifully, my boy. I\nwept at the speech about your wife.\nFlemmer materializes behind Mantini\nCHARLES NELSON REILLY\nWhat the hell? Nyong-nyong!\nMantini spins around to face Flemmer. Reilly makes a break\nfor it. Flemmer points a finger and Reilly freezes in\nmid-strut. Flemmer then points a finger at Mantini, and he,\ntoo, freezes. Flemmer picks up the giant wooden controls\nfor the marionette, and pulls a copy of the play from his\npocket.\nCUT TO:\nINT. BROADHURST STAGE - NIGHT\nWe watch the second act in progress. The Truman puppet pace\nas he delivers a monologue. Somehow he doesn't even seem to\nbe a puppet anymore, so subtle and graceful are his\nmovements and the changes in his facial expressions. It's\nas if there's a giant actual Harry Truman on stage.\nHARRY S. TRUMAN PUPPET\nI can hear the creature's voice. It's\ncalling me out of the black cave of\nthe Psyche. I shove in my dim little\ntorch, and there he stands -- waiting\nfor me. He raises his matted head. He\nopens his great, square teeth and says\n(mocking)\n'Why? ... Why me? ... Why --\nultimately -- Me? ... Do you really\nimagine you can account for Me?\nTotally, infallibly, inevitably\naccount for Me? ... Poor Dr. Dysart!'\nMalkovich watches impressed and a little scared by this\nbravura performance. He glances out into the audience and\nsees a silent, rapt crowd.\nDISSOLVE TO:\nINT. BROADHURST STAGE - A BIT LATER\nMalkovich is delivering a monologue. Acting up a storm.\nDuring Malkovich's speech, Truman repeatedly attempts to\nupstage him, nodding his head, looking thoughtful, raising\nhis ten foot eyebrows in surprise...\nMALKOVICH\nEyes! ... White eyes -- never closed!\nEyes like flames -- coming -- coming!\n... God seest! ... God seest! ... NO!\nCUT TO:\nEXT. NEW YORK STREET - CONTINUOUS\nA man hole cover is pushed off. Lotte climbs out onto the\nstreet. She is dirty but determined.\nCUT TO:\nINT. BROADHURST STAGE - LATER STILL\nMalkovich is in convulsions on the floor. Big dramatic\nconvulsions. Truman scoops him up, and places him on the\nbench. Malkovich continues with the convulsions, milking\nit. Truman speaks.\nHARRY S. TRUMAN PUPPET\nHere ... Here ... Sssh ... Sssh ...\nCalm now ... Lie back. Just lie back!\nNow breathe in deep. Very deep. In ...\nOut ... In ... Out ... That's it ...\nIn. Out .. In ... Out ...\nMalkovich is breathing insanely now, trying to keep the\nfocus on himself. Flemmer is in the catwalks, watching the\ncrowd. The audience is watching Malkovich.\nAUDIENCE MEMBER\n(to his wife)\nThat Malkovich puppet is a damn fine\nactor.\nFLEMMER\n(blood boiling)\nBastard is stealing my thunder.\nMalkovich and Truman on the stage. Truman is pacing,\nswirling, dancing, juggling enormous bowling pins as he\ntalks.\nHARRY S. TRUMAN PUPPET\nAll right! I'll take it away! He'll be\ndelivered from madness. What then?\nHe'll feel himself acceptable! What\nthen?\nMalkovich has upPed his convulsions now. He watches Truman\nout of the corner of his eye while writhing tormentedly on\nthe bench. He levitates. Spins in mid-air. Falls on all\nfours and does an uncanny impression of a yelping dog.\nTruman watches Malkovich, continues to speak. But now, when\nhe talks, fire comes out of his mouth.\nHARRY S. TRUMAN PUPPET (CONT'D)\nI'll heal the rash on his body. I'll\nerase the welts cut into his body by\nflying manes.\nThe audience \"ooohs\" at the flames. Malkovich rips off his\nclothes and convulses into the dying swan-bit from \"Swan\nLake.\" The audience applauds. Truman continues his speech,\nnow transforming himself into an actual 60 foot swan and\nflying around the auditorium as he speaks.\nHARRY S. TRUMAN PUPPET (CONT'D)\nYou won't gallop anymore, Alan. Horses\nwill be quite safe. You'll save your\npennies every week, till you can\nchange that scooter into a car...\nThe audience watches the giant swan overhead, necks craned,\nin awe. Malkovich sighs. He is out of his league. He goes\ninto a remarkable tap dance routine and sings \"Mr.\nBojangles\", but nobody even looks at the stage. The giant\nswan bursts into flames, flies back onto the stage, burns\nto a crisp, then rises from his ashes as the actual Harry S.\nTruman. Truman looks confused and disoriented, as if just\nraised from the dead.\nACTUAL TRUMAN\nWhere am I? Aren't I dead?\n(possessed)\nVote for Mantini!\nTruman grows and grows until he is again just a giant\npuppet. The audience bursts into applause, then delivers a\nstanding ovation. Truman bows. Flemmer laughs wildly in the\ncatwalks. Malkovich walks dejectedly from the stage.\nCUT TO:\nINT. BACKSTAGE - CONTINUOUS\nMalkovich walks past Maxine. She doesn't even look at him.\nThunderous applause is heard in the background.\nMALKOVICH\nGood-bye, Maxine.\nMAXINE\nWhatever.\nMalkovich drops limply to the floor. He lifts his head.\nMALKOVICH\n(weak but relieved)\nI'm back! My nightmare is over.\nCUT TO:\nINT. CATWALK - CONTINUOUS\nFlemmer watches Malkovich from above. He pulls out a\nwalkie-talkie.\nFLEMMER\n(into walkie-talkie)\nOkay, now!\nCUT TO:\nINT. CRAIG AND MAXINE'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS\nLester is surrounded by all the Malkovichians. He holds\nthe walkie-talkie, has just received word. He nods, and\nthe Malkovichians crawl in single file into the portal,\nwhile shrieking a war cry.\nCUT TO:\nINT. BACKSTAGE - CONTINUOUS\nMaxine watches as Malkovich pulls himself up off the ground.\nSuddenly, he is again possessed, first by one person, then\nby two, then by three, his body jerking and pulsating with\neach new occupant. It's almost like popping corn, starting\nout slowly, then going faster and faster, until Malkovich\nis possessed by all fifty Malkovichians. He shrieks a war\ncry and runs out onto the stage.\nCUT TO:\nINT. STAGE - CONTINUOUS\nThe Truman puppet now hangs limply from the catwalks.\nMalkovich hovers just above the stage and addresses the\naudience.\nMALKOVICH\n(now sounding like fifty voices)\nI am your earthly king! Kneel before\nme!\nThe audience scoffs at first, but then are compelled to\ntheir knees.\nCROWD\n(like automatons)\nHail Malkovich, king of the damned.\nMalkovich laughs, gives the thumbs up sign to Flemmer in\nthe catwalks. Flemmer gives the thumbs up sign back.\nLotte appears in the back of the theater, an out-of-breath\nfigure in shadows. It is too late. She runs from the\ntheater.\nCUT TO:\nINT. BACKSTAGE - CONTINUOUS\nMaxine watches, somewhat amused. She turns and heads for\nthe exit.\nCUT TO:\nEXT. NEW JERSEY TUNPIKE - NIGHT\nA dejected Craig walks along the shoulder. He is wet and\ncold. We hold on him for a long while until he eventually\nmerges with the landscape.\nFADE OUT\nFADE IN\nEXT. MANHATTAN STREET - DAY\nCHYRON: LATER THAT WEEK\nSomething is wrong. It's a typical midtown street, but\neverything is painted gray: the buildings, the streets,\nthe sidewalks, the cars. People walk along the streets,\ncarrying gray briefcases, wearing gray jumpsuits. Nobody\ntalks, nobody smiles. Gray birds fly silently in the sky.\nThere is no noise whatsoever. There are several movie\ntheaters on the block. All marquees advertise John Malkovich\nmovies. Around the corner comes Malkovich. He is floating\nabout ten feet off the ground on an enormous, bright red,\njeweled throne. He wears a gold crown and purple silk robe\nand smiles condescendingly, majestically. Floris sits on his\nlap. She is dressed in an orange satin gown. Nobody on the\nstreet looks up.\nMALKOVICH\n(fifty voices)\nGreetings, my lowly subjects.\nFLORIS\nGreat things, my lonely subtext?\nMALKOVICH\n(rolls his eyes)\nBoy, be careful what you wish for.\n(to Floris)\nNever mind, dear. Just enjoy the ride,\nwill you?\nFloris shrugs, picks at her finger nails.\nMALKOVICH (CONT'D)\n(to the people on the street)\nI am bored. You will dance for your\nking now.\nWithout pause the entire street of gray clad people breaks\ninto a meticulously choreographed production number. Totally\nsilent, totally joyless, but exquisitely executed. We see\nthat Maxine is one of the anonymous dancers. Her face is\nvoid of expression. Malkovich laughs.\nMALKOVICH (CONT'D)\nFaster! Faster, my little trained\nmonkeys!\nThe crowd dances faster and faster. Older people fall over,\nexhausted, clutching their hearts. Nobody stops dancing to\nhelp, nobody dares.\nCUT TO:\nEXT. CENTRAL PARK - DAY\nBird's eye view of the park. It's all painted gray. Every\ntree, every leaf. There's no sign of life. The camera moves\nin, through some gray trees and gray brush to:\nA LUSH GREEN OASIS CAMOUFLAGED ON THE TOP AND SIDES WITH GRAY PAINT\nThis place is filled with life: Colorful birds, lizards,\ncats, a rooster. All the animals are active, happy, but\ntotally silent, as if they know the precariousness of their\nposition. Lotte and Elijah sit among them. These are the\nanimals that she freed earlier. Lotte and Elijah hold hands\nand look into each other's eyes. We see that they both wear\ngold bands. They are husband and wife. Elijah signs.\nELIJAH (SUBTITLES)\nMust you take this terrible demon\non yourself, my love?\nLOTTE\nYes. I'm the only one. I have to enter\nMalkovich and destroy him from the\ninside. If not me, who?\nELIJAH (SUBTITLES)\nIf there was any way I could go in\nyour place. But I'm only a monkey\nand...\nLOTTE\n(puts finger to his lips)\nHush, sweetheart.\nLotte slips into a gray jumpsuit. She stuffs a homemade bomb\non her pocket. She and Elijah kiss passionately, then\nembrace.\nLOTTE\n(to the animals)\nI'll be with you always, my friends.\nWho knows, maybe if I'm lucky, I'll\nrejoin you with wings and a beak.\nELIJAH (SUBTITLES)\nWings and a halo, my darling. Wings\nand a halo.\nLotte turns quickly. This is too much to bear. She descends\ninto a storm drain. The animals stop what they're doing.\nPARROT\n(softly)\nGood-bye. Good-bye.\nDISSOLVE TO:\nEXT. MERTIN-FLEMMER BUILDING - DAY\nA man-hole cover lifts. Lotte pokes her head out. The coast\nis clear. She emerges. Assumes the dead-eyed expression of\nthe others, and enters the building.\nCUT TO:\nINT. ELEVATOR - DAY\nLotte watches the floors change. After seven, she presses\nthe emergency stop button. The elevator jerks to a halt.\nShe picks up the crow bar in the corner, pries open the\ndoor. The 7 1/2 floor is gone. Nothing is there but pipes\nand wires and beams. She climbs out onto the floor.\nCUT TO:\nINT. BETWEEN FLOORS - CONTINUOUS\nLotte searched the floor for some sign of the portal. It\nis nowhere to be found. There is a noise behind her. She\nturns with a start. It's Craig, ragged and ill-shaven.\nLOTTE\nMy God!\nCRAIG\nI'm so glad you're safe. You look\nreally wonderful.\nLOTTE\nI'm in love. For the first time.\nIt's funny, but when it happens to\nyou, there's no question.\nCRAIG\nHe's a lucky man.\n(beat)\nDo I know him?\nLOTTE\nIt's Elijah.\nCRAIG\nThe iguana?\nLOTTE\nThe monkey.\nCRAIG\nOh, right. As long as you're happy.\nI'm sure he's a better lover than I\never was.\nLOTTE\nA better friend.\nCRAIG\n(beat)\nI'm sorry for everything.\nLOTTE\n(pecking him on the cheek)\nIt's okay, Craig. It all worked out,\nin an odd sort of way.\nCRAIG\nYou came up here looking for the\nportal?\nLOTTE\nYeah. I was going to kill him from\nthe inside.\nCRAIG\nAnd yourself too in the process. God,\nyou're so beautiful. Why couldn't I\nsee that before?\nLOTTE\nYou saw it once. Now you see it again.\nThat's life, isn't it? And you were\nup here to try the same thing, weren't\nyou?\nCRAIG\nI suppose. But they got here first,\nthe lousy bastards. So now it's all\nover, I guess.\nLOTTE\nI don't know. There's a small\ncommunity of us. We have a place they\ndon't know about. We're happy. We'll\nkeep trying to figure out a way. Come\nstay with us. Join the struggle.\nCRAIG\nYou'll have me, after all I've done\nto you?\nLOTTE\nPeople make mistakes.\nCRAIG\nI'm through with puppets, Lotte.\nI just want you to know that.\nLOTTE\nI know.\nCRAIG\nI'd like to be a farmer. I want to\nhelp things grow, to encourage life.\nDo you and your friends need a farmer?\nLOTTE\nSure. We could really use a farmer.\nWe'd be grateful for the help.\n(beat)\nAlso, I think, you know, if you\nwouldn't mind too terribly, a little\npuppet show every once in a while,\nwould do a lot to lift our spirits.\nYou know, if you wouldn't mind too\nterribly.\nCraig's eyes well up with tears. Lotte looks at him sweetly.\nLOTTE (CONT'D)\nOh honey. It's gonna be okay.\nShe puts her arm around him and leads him toward the\nelevator.\nCRAIG\nI love you, Lotte.\nWe come on very close to Craig's arm as he lifts it to put\nit around Lotte. We see a thin almost invisible filament.\nWe follow it up, and discover that Craig is now a\nmarionette being controlled from above by an emotionless\nMantini in a gray jumpsuit.\nMANTINI\n(in Craig's voice)\nI can't wait to see where you and your\nfriends live, Lotte.\nLOTTE (O.S.)\nIt's beautiful, Craig, like Eden.\nNow we see filaments attached to Mantini's arms, and w\nfollow them up to find that Flemmer is controlling Mantini.\nFLEMMER\nOne serpent, coming up.\nFlemmer throws his head back and laughs. The camera moves\ninto his mouth and down his throat, which, oddly enough,\nlooks exactly like the membranous John Malkovich portal\ntunnel.\nMUSIC IN: \"Put Your Hand Inside The Puppet Head\" by They\nMight Be Giants.
